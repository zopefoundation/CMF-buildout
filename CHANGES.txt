1.2

 Features Added

  - Enabled querying actions from workflow tool in absence
    of actions tool (Tracker #401).

  - Added 'operator' attribute to CMFTopic.ListCriterion, to permit
    specifying an operator ('and', for the most part) for indexes which
    support it, e.g., KeywordIndex (Tracker #442).

  - Added ZMI interface for editing Link URL (Tracker #364).

 Bugs Fixed

  - Fixed a bug where the workflow notifyCreated method was called during
    manage_afterAdd in PortalContent, making it possible for the
    notification to occur on the wrong workflow.  The notification has 
    moved to the contstructInstance method on the TypesTool after
    the _setPortalTypeName method has been called on the object.

  - Fixed a bug in Favorites.getObject to use restrictedTraverse on the portal
    object.

  - Fixed setting the Link.format to URL_FORMAT so the initially returned
    metadata headers would return 'text/url' properly.  Added unittests.

  - Fixed CMFDefault.utils.parseHeadersBody to properly handle the headers
    generated on a windows app (i.e. Dreamweaver) with /r/n; added the
    compiled regular expression object to the method signature.

  - Added full webdav sipport code to Link.py.  Changed _writeFromPUT to call
    _editMetadata instead of editMetadata.

  - Cleaned up emission of RFC822-style headers (Tracker #407),
    terminating headers must be terminated with CRLF, and padding
    continuation lines (for values with embedded newlines) with
    leading whitespace).

  - Added external method update_catalogIndexes.py to run as part of a
    upgrade to CMFs migrating to Zope2.4+ from from CMF sites which were built
    using Zope2.3 catalog

  - Use ID to label Favorite when target has an empty Title (Tracker #440).

  - Allowed sub-folders to have different syndication properties 
    than parents (Tracker #421).

  - Added 'CMFDefault.Upgrade.upgrade_decor_skins' external method to
    convert existing sites which had installed skin directories from the
    now-deprecated 'CMFDecor' product (Tracker #434).  Added note
    explaining the issue, and the workaround, to 'ISSUES.txt'.

  - Ensure that Favorites display the correct, absolute URL to their
    target, without needing to have <base> tag set (Tracker #419).

  - Worked around Opera's strange insistence on selecting an option,
    even for multi-select lists (Tracker #332).

  - Hardened CMFCore to initialize correctly in the absence of
    the PageTemplates product (Tracker #430).

  - Restored slot in <head> of ZPT main template into which content
    can insert the <base> tag (Tracker #418).

  - Fixed 'CMFTopic.SimpleIntegerCriterion.edit' to require a pair
    of values when 'direction' is 'min:max';  updated skins to use
    new 'getValueString', which renders such values properly
    (Tracker #439).

  - Ensured that Documents created with initial STX get cooked
    (Tracker #435).

  - Made links emitted by 'topic_view' play nice with virtual hosting
    (Tracker #433).

  - Made 'CMFCore/interfaces/__init__.py' non-empty, to remove suspicion
    that the file was corrupted in the download (Tracker #426).
