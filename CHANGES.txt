After CMF 1.6.4

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCore.WorkflowTool: Using the '(Default)' keyword for a type's 
      workflow chain will now reset any custom workflow chains for the type
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/475)

    - User folders not supporting the userFolderDelUsers API, such as PAS,
      would raise an unhelpful error when members were deleted using the
      portal_membership tool.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/481)

    - Backported test fix from 2.1 branch which suppresses race conditions
      in date-based topic criteria tests.

CMF 1.6.4 (2007/05/15):

  (No changes since 1.6.4-beta)

CMF 1.6.4-beta (2007/04/24):

  Other Changes

    - Switch to using GenericSetup 1.2 final release (From 1.2beta).

  Bug Fixes

    - Fixed test breakage / spew when running on Zope 2.8.

    - Use the property API to get the member specific skin, because
      direct attribute access won't work with PAS based membership.
      (http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/5904)

    - Add POST-only protections to security critical methods (see
      http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0240).

    - Fixed DST-driven test breakage in CMFCalendar by adding an optional
      'zone' argument to the DublineCore methods which return string
      rednitions of date metadata.

CMF 1.6.3-beta (2007/01/17)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCalendar: Refactored test setup to fix test breakage for Zope 2.9.

    - CMFDefault: The "Sample CMF Content" GenericSetup profile was 
      registered but missing all of its files and necessary interface 
      declarations in the CMFDefault content classes.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/453)

    - DCWorkflow: Fixed errors and site breakage on GenericSetup import 
      of transitions with variable expressions set.  They were previously 
      being imported as text rather tha Expressions.

    - CMFCore.DynamicType: Fixed behaviour regarding default view.
      DynamicType was making it impossible to use a Zope3-style
      default view for CMF content types.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/459)


CMF 1.6.2 (2006/08/15)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCore.FSDTMLMethod: Add class-default '_owner', to prevent unintended
      acquisition of ownership (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/450)


CMF 1.6.2-beta (2006/08/08)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCore.CatalogTool: Added 'cmf_uid' method to IndexableObjectWrapper
      so that CMFUid UIDs are not acquired during indexing.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/446)

    - CMFCore.PortalContent:  '_guessAliases' may leave type information
      with a default alias of '(Default)';  work around that case.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/445)

    - standard_error_message.pt was out of sync with Zope.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/Zope/2133)

  Other

    - CMFUid: Removed remnants of CMFSetup. Made sure the extension profile is
      registered for ISiteRoot.

      ISiteRoot.


CMF 1.6.1 (2006/06/09)

  Other

    - Updated GenericSetup to trunk at revision 68556


CMF 1.6.1-beta (2006/06/03)

  Bug Fixes

    - Forward-ported fix for DCWorkflow global actions missing IDs
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/308).

      'request' was not set correctly if 'object' is not specified.

    - CMFCore.interfaces._tools: Corrected the API given for 
      WorkflowDefinition.isActionSupported.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/407)

      The interfaces declared for the wrapped object are no longer masked.

    - Correct software dependencies in INSTALL.txt


CMF 1.6.0-beta (2006/02/19)

  Bug Fixes

    - Removed BBBTransaction class from CMFCore.utils

    - Extension profiles: Fixed import of actions, now they don't
      overwrite all previous actions in the action provider. Fixed
      import of action icons.

  Features

    - CMFCore.FSDTMLMethod/FSImage/FSFile: Added 304 Not Modified support
      analogous to the support added for FSPageTemplates earlier on.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/402)

    - Replaced Z2 interfaces w/ Z3 interfaces, dynamically creating Z2
      interfaces via bridge

    - Back-ported the GenericSetup style of site creation from CMF trunk

    - FSFile: autodetect the encoding of UTF-8 text files with a
      suitable Byte Order Mark (0xEF 0xBB 0xBF).

    - CMFSetup: Split off GenericSetup.
      GenericSetup allows to use CMFSetup functionality outside CMF. See
      the README.txt of GenericSetup for details. 

  Others

    - CMFCore utils: Made _checkPermission depend on Zope's checkPermission.
      There is no longer a need to modify the checkPermission behavior in CMF.

    - Reordered base classes of File and Image, to allow use of super().

    - Changed TypesTool.manage_addTypeInformation method to log a warning
      instead of raise an exception if the typeinfo_name is not found.
