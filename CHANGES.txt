CMF 2.2.0-beta (unreleased)

  New Features

    - CMFDefault.Document and CMFDefault.NewsItem: It is now possible to
      register a utility (ILinebreakNormalizer) that can normalize line 
      breaks upon editing or rendering out to FTP.

    - CMFDefault.Document and CMFDefault.NewsItem: Added a format choice for
      ReStructuredText.
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/485)

    - CMFCalendar.CalendarTool: Added a new method getNextEvent to grab the
      next event relative to a given point in time.

  Bug Fixes

    - DCWorkflow.exportimport: Scripts with invalid types imported
      after scripts with valid types will no longer place the valid
      script twice.  Scripts can also now be specified with meta_types
      other than the hard-coded meta_types.

  Others

    - CMFUid: Removed redundant and unexpected code to auto-create catalog
      index and column for the UID handler tool. The index and column are
      already created by the default CMFUid GenericSetup profile.

    - interfaces: Removed deprecated oldstyle interfaces.

    - CMFCore.MembershipTool: Removed ancient LoginManager compatibility code
      and deprecated the no longer needed __getPUS method.

    - Testing: Derive test layers from ZopeLite layer if available.
