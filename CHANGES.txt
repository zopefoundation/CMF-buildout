CMF 2.1.0-beta (unreleased)

  New Features

    - Added CMFCore.FSRestMethod:  ReST equivalent of FSSTXMethod.

    - CMFCore.FSSTXMethod:  Modernized, added tests, made customization
      possible (now renders via ZPT by default, using 'main_template').

    - Portal: Added 'email_charset' property.

    - CMFDefault utils: Added 'makeEmail' function.

    - CMFDefault.Image and CMFDefault.File: Overridden index_html methods
      add Cache Policy Manager-awareness and thus bring these implementations
      in line with CMFCore.FSFile and CMFCore.FSImage
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/454)

  Bug Fixes

    - Fixed test breakage induced by use of Z3 pagetempalates in Zope 2.10+.

    - CMFDefault skins: Fixed encoding issues in welcome and reminder emails.
      'password_email' and 'registered_email' now encode their return value
      correctly, using 'email_charset' and the new 'makeEmail' function.


CMF 2.1.0-alpha (2006/10/09)

  New Features

    - CMFDefault utils: Added getBrowserCharset function.
      Returns the charset preferred by the browser. Strings encoded with this
      charset are decoded correctly by Five.browser.decode.processInputs.

    - Content: Added IFactory utilities for all content classes.
      They are now used by default instead of the old constructor methods.

    - FactoryTypeInformation: Added support for Zope3 style factories.
      If the 'product' property of a type info instance is empty the 'factory'
      property is interpreted as an IFactory name.

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCore.ActionInformation: don't use a fixed set of properties for
      ActionInformation. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/232/)

    - CMFCore.CatalogTool: Use current executable's proxy roles, if any,
      in place of user's roles when computing 'allowedRolesAndUsers' for
      a query. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/380)

  Others

    - skins: Changed encoding of translated portal_status_messages.
      Now getBrowserCharset is used to play nice with Five forms. Customized
      setRedirect and getMainGlobals scripts have to be updated.

    - FSFile: Added registration for 'txt' extension.

    - Profiles: All profiles are now registered by ZCML.

    - ZClasses: Removed unmaintained support for ZClasses.
      Marked the 'initializeBases*' methods as deprecated. 

    - Content: All content classes are now registered by ZCML.
      ContentInit is still used to register oldstyle constructors.

    - Favorite: Added 'handleFavoriteAddedEvent' subscriber.
      This replaces the 'manage_afterAdd' hook and some code in 'addFavorite'.

    - CMFCatalogAware: Added 'handleObjectEvent' subscriber.
      This replaces the deprecated 'manage_afterAdd', 'manage_afterClone' and
      'manage_beforeDelete' hooks.

    - setup handlers: Removed support for CMF 1.5 CMFSetup profiles.
