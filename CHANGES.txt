CMF 1.5.0-alpha (2004/07/09)

  New Features

    - CMFActionIcons product is now shipped as part of the CMF release.

    - New portal_setup tool provides export / import of various site
      configuration choices, both as tarballs and as TTW "snapshots".
      See the "README":CMFSetup/README.txt.

    - zpt skin: Some forms are now scripts.
      These scripts are dispatchers that call validators and controllers and
      set redirect depending on the selected button. If redirect is not set,
      the script calls a template and returns the resulting HTML page.

    - ActionProviderBase, ActionInformation: Added methods to modify/edit 
      actions. New method 'getActionObject' in 'ActionProviderBase' and 
      'edit' method in 'ActionInformation' (Collector 195).
      An action now may be modified/edited the following way::

        action_provider.getActionObject('object/view').edit(title='VIEW')

    - Topic objects now support syndication (Collector #203).

    - PortalFolder and zpt skin: PortalFolder now inherits from OrderedFolder.

      o Added buttons to 'folder_contents' that allow to set a default sorting
        for each PortalFolder or to order the sub-objects by hand.

      o Modified 'index_html' to show sub-objects in the selected order. The
        old 'index_html' is still available as 'index_html_categorized'.

    - CMFDefault utils: Added 'html_marshal' function.
      This is similar to ZTUtils.make_hidden_input(), but returns a sequence
      of (name, value) pairs instead of html code.

    - CMFCore utils and content types: Marked _getViewFor as deprecated.
      __call__() and view() methods using _getViewFor() are deprecated as
      well. Use Method Aliases instead.

    - CMFDefault Site: Now adds the 'Classic' DCWorkflow on creation.
      If DCWorkflow is not installed, no default workflow is added.

    - DynamicType: Added 'getActionInfo' method.
      This is a shortcut to getActionInfo() of the related TypeInformation.

    - DublinCore: setModificationDate is now guarded by 'ModifyPortalContent'.

    - zpt skin: Reimplemented 'folder_contents' and related controllers.
      Uses a dispatcher script that calls the right validators and controllers
      if a form button is pushed. The result looks almost the same as before.

    - PortalFolder and SkinnedFolder: Added 'new' and 'rename_items' Actions.
      Used for redirects they are invisible by default.

    - CMFCore exceptions: Added some Exceptions.
      AccessControl.Unauthorized is a subclass of zExceptions.Unauthorized, so
      for best results use 'AccessControl_Unauthorized' to raise Unauthorized
      and 'zExceptions_Unauthorized' to catch them all. 'CopyError' and
      'ResourceLockedError' are now also available for TTW code.
      'EditingConflict' is a new CMF class replacing the old string exception.

    - Callable Opaque Items, CMFCatalogAware: Added an interface
      'ICallableOpaqueItemWithHooks'. CMF now calls the manage_after*
      and manage_before* hooks of a marked opaque item on copying,
      moving or deleting the containing content object.

    - DublinCore: Creator element no longer depends on Ownership.
      (Collector #25)

      o Added listCreators() and listContributors() to the DublinCore
        Interface. Creator() now returns the first element of listCreators().
        Contributors() is now a deprecated alias of listContributors() and
        might change in a future version.

      o Updated DublinCore implementation in DefaultDublinCoreImpl and
        DiscussionItem. Added new addCreator() method that is called by
        notifyModified(). SkinnedFolder also uses the new methods.

      o Updated ContentFilter to work with listCreators().

      o Updated CatalogTool to index listCreators. Creator index and metadata
        are deprecated and might be removed in a future version.

      o Updated skins to search listCreators() and show all creators.

    - TypeInfos: _finishConstruction() now calls reindexObject().
      This makes sure changes made by ScriptableTypeInformation scripts are
      indexed and notifyModified() is called after content creation.

    - Document: Removed WorkflowMethod wrapper of setFormat().
      This was the only wrapped MutableDublinCore method and caused an ugly
      second reindexObject() / notifyModified() call in the middle of
      _editMetadata().

    - CatalogTool: Updated to post Zope 2.6.2 ZCatalog interface.
      'catalog_object()' and 'reindexObject()' now support the new
      'update_metadata' argument. 'reindexObjectSecurity()' doesn't update
      catalog metadata anymore.

    - Added new hook to CookieCrumbler "twiddleAuthCookie". The
      twiddleAuthCookie skin script, if present is called on each request
      where a cookie authentication token is present. It is passed the auth
      cookie name and value so that it can perform such functions as
      extending the expiration of the cookie. A twiddleAuthCookie script
      along with a setAuthCookie script could create login sessions that
      timeout after a period of inactivity for example.

    - Refactored ActionsTool and Action providers:

      o Added listActionInfos() and getActionInfo() to the ActionProvider
        Interface, added 'object' argument to listActions().

      o Added OldstyleActionProvider Interface and OldstyleActionProviderBase
        for Action providers still not using ActionInformation objects.
        WorkflowTool and CMFCore DiscussionTool use this.

      o Action providers queried by ActionsTool should implement the new
        ActionProvider Interface. Action providers subclassing
        ActionProviderBase inherit the necessary methods.

      o To ease transition it will be sufficient to implement the
        OldstyleActionProvider Interface, using OldstyleActionProviderBase.
        The use of Action providers not implementing one of these Interfaces
        is deprecated. Support for them will be removed after CMF 1.5.

      o Added helper methods getOAI() and getExprContext() to get computed
        contexts from REQUEST cache or create new ones.

    - CMFDefault MembershipTool and zpt skin: Added 'Manage members' Action.
      The skin now provides basic membership management: Browsing members,
      registering new members and deleting members including their member
      data, member area and Local Roles.

    - The caching policy manager now sets the header
      'X-Cache-Headers-Set-By' when it sets cache headers
      in a response.

    - FSDTMLMethods now play nicely with the caching policy manager.

    - zpt skin: Added batch_widgets.pt and getBatchNavigation.py.
      roster and search use now the new navigation macro. Looks like before,
      but i18n works better and it's easier to reuse or replace the code.

    - zpt skin: Added zpt version of registered_notify_template.

    - CMFCorePermissions: Made them available for import by Scripts.

    - CMFCore MembershipTool and MemberDataTool: Added 'delete' methods.

      o deleteMemberData() deletes the member data of a member.

      o deleteMemberArea() deletes the member area of a member.

      o deleteLocalRoles() now has a 'recursive' argument.

      o deleteMembers() deletes members including member data, member area and
        Local Roles.

    - CMFCore MembershipTool: Changed interface.

      o createMemberarea() is now called createMemberArea(). For backwards
        compatibility createMemberarea is a deprecated alias.

      o getMembersFolder() is now also part of the CMFCore interface.

    - CMFCorePermissions: Added 'Change local roles' Permission.
      PortalFolder's 'Local Roles' Action and MembershipTool's Local Roles
      methods are now guarded by 'Change local roles' of the object.

    - Added CMFCore 'exceptions.py': Errors defined in this module are
      available for import by Scripts.

    - CMFCore and CMFDefault MembershipTool: Changed permissions.
      'createMemberarea()' for someone else and 'getRoster()' including hidden
      members are now protected by 'Manage users'. 'getMemberById()',
      listMemberIds() and listMembers() as well.

    - Document and NewsItem: Un-hardwired 'manage_FTPget()' for 'text/html'.
      Added 'source_html.dtml' and 'source_html.pt'. 'manage_FTPget()' now has
      a 'gethtml' hook and uses 'source_html' by default. (Collector #168)

    - TypeInformation: Added Method Aliases.

      o TypesTool and TypeInformation now have an 'Aliases' tab to configure
        Method Aliases TTW.

      o factory_type_information now has a key 'aliases' to configure Method
        Aliases in a product. This key is required, but may be empty: If it
        doesn't exist, TypeInformation will try to update by guessing aliases.

      o DynamicType manipulates 'TraversalRequestNameStack' depending on
        Method Aliases. '(Default)' and 'view' aliases bypass __call__() and
        view() methods on traversal.

      o PortalFolder's 'mkdir' hook now makes use of Method Aliases.

    - CMFCore and CMFDefault MembershipTool: Changed member area creation.
      'wrapUser()' does no longer call 'createMemberarea()'.
      'createMemberarea()' should now be called from the 'logged_in' page.

    - CMFDefault MembershipTool: Added a customization hook to
      'createMemberarea()'. A 'createMemberContent' script placed inside the
      tool overrides default member content creation.

  Bug Fixes

    - zpt skin: Removed dependency on dtml layers.

    - CMFCore utils: Marked 'format_stx' function as deprecated.
      It's no longer necessary to work around default STX handling.

    - DirectoryView: Refactored path handling.
      Should now work with any products path setup. (Collector #210)

    - Enforced new "local permissions" pattern:  each top-level CMF product
      should have a 'permissions.py' module which imports / declares all
      permissions used within the product;  other modules within the product
      should import from there.  Likewise for 'exceptions.py'.

    - Removed pre Zope 2.7.0 compatibility code. Now Zope 2.7.0 or a later
      platform is required for CMF.

    - CatalogTool: Marked the 'meta_type' index as deprecated.

    - PortalFolder: Marked the 'spec' argument as deprecated.
      Use the 'filter' argument with 'portal_type' instead for contentItems(),
      contentIds(), contentValues() and listFolderContents().

    - PortalFolder: Fixed portal_type acquisition bug in ContentFilter.

    - DynamicType: Added 'getPortalTypeName()' to the interface.

    - Collector #227:  expose ZPT filename in tracebacks which include
      FSPageTemplates.

    - zpt skin: Switched base tag policy back to that of dtml skin.
      This makes the use of relative URLs in content easier. If you have
      content that depends on the old policy you can customize getBaseTag.pt
      and add a slash. (Collector #66)

    - Actions of folderish types: Fixed some inconsistencies.
      Whatever the old CMFDefault policy was - this is the current policy:
      "object" is used for Actions related to the object itself, "folder" is
      used for Actions related to the container of the object.

      o Changed the category of PortalFolder and SkinnedFolder Actions to
        'object'.

      o Moved 'folderContents' of folderish types from ActionsTool to
        PortalFolder's type info. Other folderish types now have to declare
        their own 'folderContents' Action if they need one.

      o Renamed Topic's 'subtopics' and SkinnedFolder's 'foldercontents'
        Action to 'folderContents' to get them in sync.

    - StrippingParser: Added 'big', 'small', 'sub' and 'sup' to valid tags.

    - _checkPermission: Added check for executable owner and proxy roles.

    - SkinsContainer: Fixed context wrappers returned by getSkinByPath().
      The original context of skin folders is now removed. This avoids having
      SkinTool attributes added to the CMFSite root object.

    - CatalogTool: Removed deprecated 'id' from default indexes and metadata.

    - Skins: Fixed a DateTime related issue in search_form and doFormSearch.
      Added one second to epoch to work around the problem that the timezone
      gets lost if time is 00:00:00.

    - CMFCore.PortalFolder: Explicitly declare base interfaces.

    - Tests: CachingPolicyManager tests don't fail on Windows anymore.
      (Collector #107)

    - SkinsTool: Fixed cookie paths.
      clearSkinCookie() now uses the same cookie path as updateSkinCookie()
      which is now "inside-out" hosting safe.

    - DefaultDublinCoreImpl: Changed accessor permissions.
      As defined in the interface accessors are now protected by 'View'.

    - CMFDefault utils: Made 'tuplize()' work correctly with string types.

    - CMFCore utils: Reverted obsolete workaround in _checkPermission.

    - Skin scripts: Made except statements safer by being more specific. Hope
      this still catches all relevant errors.

    - Removed some pre 'Zope 2.4.3 with PageTemplates' backwards compatibility
      cruft. A later platform is required since CMF 1.3.

    - Collector #153: CookieCrumbler didn't preserve query strings.
