1.1 beta

 New features

  - Added CMFCore.utils.keywordsplitter to construct 'Subject'
    dublin core header from both 'Keywords' and 'Subject' headers
    passed in (meta tags/rfc822).

  - CMF Document now uses StructuredTextNG for structured text
    handling.  Nicely enough, it uses the "with images" features, and
    also enables named and inner links.

  - CMF Document exposes two new accessor methods for getting at the
    "cooked" and editable body, 'CookedBody()', and 'EditableBody()'.
    Using the 'cooked_text' and 'text' instance attributes should be
    considered deprecated.

  - Added new "exemplar" content product, CMFCalendar, which
    (for now) adds a simple content object, Event.  This product
    serves a similar didactic purpose as CMFTopic (which is now
    "in the core"):  it shows how to build new content types as
    filesystem products.

  - Implemented improved "safety belt" for concurrent Document
    editing.  See the dogbowl proposal,
     http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/ContentSafetyBelt

  - Added new filesystem-based skin method type, FSSTXMethod, for
    creating "methods" which render STX.

  - Exposed "controlled vocabulary" for Subject in
    'metadata_edit_form'.

  - Gave 'portal_skins' tool its own PUT_factory (Tracker #238).
    Allows site builder to create skin methods via WebDAV/FTP,
    including ZPT, PythonScripts, etc.

  - Implemented "outbound" segment of the "Syndication tool"
    proposal, q.v.,
     http://cmf.zope.org/CMF/Members/andrew/folderRSS

  - Made 'PUT_factory' use new 'content_type_registry' tool.

  - Made 'PUT_factory' use 'invokeFactory', so that objects
    created via PUT have their 'portal_type' set properly.

  - Added ContentTypeRegistry class and related predicates for
    mapping PUT requests (name,content_type,body) to type object
    names.

  - Allowed Reviewers to "retract" published content owned by
    others.

  - Added "Overview" ZMI view to tools.

  - Added "Dublin Core" ZMI view to PortalContent;  added an
    editing view for Document and derivatives.

  - Added "drop-in" workflow objects to the WorkflowTool,
    including the ability to map workflows onto content types.

  - Changed CMFDefault.Portal to install CMF Topic by default
    when building a new CMF Site.

  - Added a new criteria type, *FriendlyDateCriterion*, to
    CMFTopic for building queries like 'When effective_date is
    less than five days old'.

  - Implemented 'portal_metadata' tool.  See the dogbowl
    proposal,
    http://cmf.zope.org/rqmts/proposals/completed/metadata_tool. 

  - Extended DirectoryView objects to reload when the directory
    they represent has changed, if Zope is running in debug mode.

  - Added hooks to CookieCrumbler to permit site managers to
    customize seting/expiring of the authentication cookie by
    adding PythonScripts; two default filesystem implementations
    are in CMFDefault's "control" skin.

  - Extended TypesTool to deal appropriately with DTML factory
    methods (e.g., for ZClasses).

  - Made FSDTMLMethods searchable from the ZMI (Issue PTK(251)[]).

 Bug Fixes

  - Added 'manage_beforeDelete' to DiscussionItemContainer class,
    and propagated to it from content deletion (Tracker #269).

  - Only display the "join" action if the user has the "Add
    portal member" permission.

  - Check for appropriate REQUEST variables before invoking
    CopySupport machinery, return a nice 'portal_status_message'
    instead of allowing the traceback to kick in (Tracker #247).

  - Initialize default DublinCore metadata for the site, so that
    *some* value is available everywhere (Tracker #285).

  - Add module-level globals aliases, to permit other products
    to use elements of skins (Tracker #273).

  - Replaced 'metadata_edit' DTMLMethod with PythonScript.

  - Updated 'metadata_edit' to avoid clearing values not passed
    in REQUEST (Tracker #268).

  - Removed spurious whitespace being added to Subject.

  - Fixed FSPythonScript to open file in text mode, so that
    Windows verstions with CR don't cause the parser to choke
    (Tracker #284).

  - Simplified login-disabling logic in CookieCrumbler.

  - Added '<base>' tag to headers of Document, NewsItem, and
    DiscussionItem so that relative links work properly.

  - Fixed the ActionsTool to suppress adding a trailing '/' to
    "empty" action URL's.

  - Fixed Document's content type sniffing to deal with odd case
    in which "entire" HTML document was embedded as an STX
    example.

  - Replaced literal string permissins with "named permissions",
    imported from modules in most places. (Please report any
    which escaped!)

  - Moved 'factory_type_information' registry entries back out
    to the relevant modules (instead of lumping them in
    CMFDefault.Portal).

  - Simplified NewsItem to "Document with a twist" (NewsItems now
    inherit lots of useful behavior from Document.

  - Aliased DublinCore's Format() as 'content_type', so that
    Zope's WebDAV support will do the Right Thing (TM) when
    handling a PROPFIND.

  - Suppressed "eager redirect" behavior in CookieCrumbler for
    FTP or WebDAV (note that WebDAV fix only works for "extra"
    HTTP methods; GET/PUT/POST still redirect).

  - Made sure to update the catalog when a content object's
    parent is deleted / moved (Tracker #261).

  - Fixed lossage to File objects when no upload supplied
    (Tracker #271).

  - Fixed "Add to Favorites" when applied to Folders.

  - Suppressed "Members" link in topbar (pointed to 'roster' method)
    for users who would not be able to see it.

  - Fixed irritating bugs in setting of skin-selection cookie.

  - Removed ugly '_mimetype_registry' hack for 'PUT_factory'.

  - Fixed a bug in CMFDefault.Document with PUT that only affected
    FTP: when a StructuredText document that contained a full HTML
    example (complete with <html>, <head>, and <body> tags) in its
    body, it would pass the "does it smell like HTML" test and throw
    everything away that wasn't inside the first matching pair of
    <body> tags it found.  Funnily enough, this bug was exposed when
    trying to save an article about how to use FTP with Zope and the
    CMF that contained such an example.

  - Fixed glitch caused by '<dtml-return>' in
    CMFDefault/skins/control/reconfig.dtml.  Thanks to Hans de Wit
    <hw@scp.nl> for reporting this!

  - Allowed 'portal_type' to be a method, as well as an attribute
    (eases ZClass-as-content).

  - Fixed search form to pass 'created' instead of 'date' (probably
    need 'modified', too);  also, added selection list for 'Subject',
    and fixed the "Last Month" option value.

  - Fixed non-import in CMFCore/WorkflowCore.py (Tracker #239,
    thanks to 'snej' for the patch).

  - Updated CatalogTool to handle searchable vs. displayable DublinCore
    dates properly.

  - Replaced usage of .id with .getId() all through the CMF, to
    conform with the new SimpleItem API. Thanks to Jens Quade
    <jq@jquade.de> for pointing this out. (Issue PTK(241)[]).

  - Extended 'index_html' to render portal description using STX
    (Tracker #246).

  - Updated CMFDefault skins to use Contentish.getIcon, including
    the portal catalog. This greatly simplifies using ZClasses as
    content. In CMFDefault/scripts you will find
    'convertCatalogGetIconColumn.pys), a Python Script that will
    convert your existing Catalog to use 'getIcon' instead of
    'icon' (Issue PTK(244)[]). Also, synched interface definition
    to show the 'relative_to_portal' argument.

  - Extended 'folder_factories' to filter type objects using
    'isConstructionAllowed' in 'PortalFolder.allowedContentTypes'
    (Tracker #249).

  - Fixed display of replies on discussion items.

  - Made appropriate use of 'portal_url', instead of BASEPATH
    ad hockery, in skin methods (Tracker #259).

  - Synched interface definition of 'Contentish.getIcon' with
    reality (documented 'relative' parameter).

  - Fixed "Ever" entry in 'search_form' to use a value safe in
    timezones east of GMT (Tracker #236).

  - Deprecated the CMFDefault.File.download method; it is still
    available, but is no longer called by the current CMF skin,
    nor is index_html aliased to it.

    The method was necessary when the "View' method was the
    default action when calling the URL of the File object, this
    is no longer the case. The setting of the Content-Disposition
    header is not needed when using the absolute URL of the
    object, and causes certain browsers to misbehave.
