After CMF 1.4.8

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCore.FSObject:  Make FSObject-derivatives role managers, so that
      role settings in '.metadata' files work.  Thanks to Dieter Maurer for
      the patch!  (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/359)

    - DCWorkflow.Scripts:  Usinng inherited manage_main requires wrapping 
      for Zope 2.8 compatibility.

    - CMFDefault.SyndicationTool: Zope 2.8 raises AttributeError where
      earlier Zopes used to raise KeyError.

    - Set cache headers in 304 responses from FSImage / FSFile
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/355)

    - Sync catalog metadata column with correct name of DublinCore string
      ExpirationDate method. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/345)

    - Ensure that syndication tool coerces property values into correct
      types. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/344)

    - Hide 'test_all' from the "standard" testrunner in Zope 2.7, to
      avoid duplicating test runs (which can lead to spurious test failures).
      'bin/zopectl test' from an instance home with CMF installed should now
      run all tests cleanly.  Backport from the 1.5 changes a year back.
      'bin/zopctl run <path/to>/all_cmf_tests.py' is a deprectated way
      to run (mostly) the same tests.

    - Fixed Creator() to not call a potentially costly method on the
      user folder. (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/300)

    - CMFCatalogAware: When reindexing security, all subobjects must be
      reindexed even if they are not visible by the current user. Also
      fixed to work correctly with Zope >= 2.7.6.

    - CMFCore.Skinnable: Don't catch ConflictError in __of__.

    - CMFCore.FSPageTemplate, CMFCore.FSImage:  Remove two more
      Z28-incompatible borrowings of bound methods from base classes
      (http://www.zope.org/Collectors/CMF/321)

  New Features

    - CatalogTool.CatalogTool now has a private 'unrestrictedSearchResults'
      method bypassing the effective and expiry date and roles. The new
      method has to be used with care to not expose security holes in
      applications using the CatalogTool.

CMF 1.4.8 (2005/03/18)

  Bug Fixes

    - DiscussionTool.getResponseFor was not checkin for the
      DiscussionResponse interface before acquiring, which could result
      in the wrong object being returned in some environments.

    - The MemberDataTool was storing a ImplicitAcquirerWrapper on
      registerMemberData.

    - Changed some places where a bound-method was being bound to a
      different class to use the .im_func of the method

    - Got rid of all uses of apply()

    - FactoryTypeInformation.manage_propertiesForm was being called
      unwrapped.

    - CMFDefault.RegistrationTool: Allow '+' in e-mail addresses.
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/322)

    - DCWorkflow.DCWorkflow:  include transition ID in the dict for
      workflow actions (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/308).

    - CMFCore.CatalogTool: Take into account query restrictions on
      'effective' or 'expires' attributes during a search.
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/120)

    - FSFile, FSImage: Made available to caching policy manager as
      standard content. (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/299)

    - CMFCore.FSPageTemplate: Don't hide sub-tracebacks in development mode.

    - CMFCore.FSPageTemplate:  Smoothed an incompatibility with Zope 2.8
      due to inappropriate borrowing of an unbound method from
      ZopePageTemplate.

    - CMFDefault.DiscussionItem: Workflow did not get notified when a 
      DiscussionItem was added to content.
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/280)
  
CMF 1.4.7 (2004/08/11)

  New Features

    - Minor featurelet: The "Action Providers" ZMI tab on the portal_actions 
      tool now links directly to the tools shown 
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/181)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCore.PortalFolder: Enforce check of "Delete objects" permission
      during cut + paste. (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/259)

      N.B.  This fix depends on an update to the underlying Zope software,
            e.g., Zope 2.7.3 or later.  Two new unit tests fail on
            Zope 2.7.2 and earlier.

    - CMFDefault.MetadataTool: Validation would disallow
      vocabulary-constrained metadata elements to be empty
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/217)

    - CMFDefault.DiscussionItem: Replies were not sorted chronologically
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/211)

    - CMFDefault.Image and CMFDefault.File: When copy/pasting Image and File
      objects the review state did not revert to "private".
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/176)

    - CMFTopic: Change topic_view template to show title and ID (it only
      showed title before; http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/180)

    - CMFCore.PortalFolder: Unlike other content, only Managers were able
      to create PortalFolders using mkdir in FTP. Fixed by inserting
      missing security declaration for PortalFolder.manage_addFolder 
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/167)

    - Default text format for NewsItems is now structured-text, just like
      it is for Documents, thus removing a spurious difference
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/138).

    - CMFCalendar.CalendarTool: (Lost) fix for issues 65 and 159.
      The determination of the date/time range constituting a specific month
      was faulty.

    - CMFDefault.DublinCore: Use the portal_metadata tool's 'getPublisher'
      for the DublinCore 'Publisher' element (thanks to Eric Brown for the 
      patch).

    - CMFDefault.Document: Make Document render compliant XHTML when format
      is 'plain' (thanks to Eric Brown for the patch).

CMF 1.4.6 (2004/07/30)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCalendar.Event: Fixed long-standing bug where day, month, and year
      were processed in the wrong order by Event.edit().
      (http://zope.org/Collectors/CMF/202)

    - CMFCalendar.Event: PUT() caused improper splitting of 'Contributors'
      metadata header.

    - CMFCalendar.CalendarTool: Code assumed US datetime format throughout.
      At least since Zope 2.7 users can change that.
      (http://plone.org/collector/3218)

    - CMFCore.PortalFolder: _verifyObjectPaste() did not check the
      container's allowed content types, enabling users to paste objects
      they were not allowed to add.
      (http://plone.org/collector/2183)

    - CMFDefault.File and CMFDefault.Image: setFormat() failed to update
      the content_type property causing a stale mimetype to be used when
      serving the file or image.
      (http://plone.org/collector/1323)

    - CMFDefault.Document and CMFDefault.Link: PUT() caused improper
      splitting of 'Contributors' metadata header.
      (http://plone.org/collector/3217)
      
    - CMFCore.utils: Introduced contributorsplitter() utility function.

    - CMFCore.PortalFolder: checkIdAvailable() failed to catch 
      zExceptions.BadRequest.

CMF 1.4.5 (2004/07/08)

  Bug Fixes

    - When someone customises something twice, rather than raise an error,
      show them a nice message and takes them to the already customised
      object.

    - FSImage didn't recognize '.bmp' files (Collector #245).

    - Further hardening of member property, 'email', to prevent trickier
      header injection into system-generated e-mails (Collector #243 redux).

CMF 1.4.4 (2004/05/14)

  Bug Fixes

    - Unchecked member property, 'email', could allow header injection
      into system-generated e-mails (Collector #243).

CMF 1.4.3 (2004/04/22)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCalendar.CalendarTool: Converted '_usage' queries to dictionary
      syntax. Shuts up DeprecationWarnings in Zope 2.7.

    - CMFCore.CachingPolicyManager:  make REQUEST argument optional
      for public methods, to ease scripting policy operations from
      setup code. (Collector #234)

    - Action definitions: Removed leading spaces. (Collector #229)

CMF 1.4.3-rc1 (2004/02/05)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFCore.PortalFolder: Explicitly declare base interfaces.

    - CMFCore.MembershipTool: Don't swallow ConflictError during wrapUser.

    - CMFDefault.SkinnedFolder: Creator() method now resembles the one from
      DublinCore. This allows for unowned objects and shuts up a deprecation
      warning in Zope 2.6.4/2.7.0.

    - CMFCore.CookieCrumbler: No longer disregards an existing cookie auth
      token for DAV requests (like PROPFIND) that occur over the main HTTP
      port. Eliminates additional user challenges for browser-based DAV
      clients like MS WebFolders.

    - CMFCore.FSMetadata: the "acquire" flag for permission mappings was
      not converted to an int;  '0' was therefore coming through as true.

    - CMFCore.FSPageTemplate.py: compatibiltity with Python 2.3 (can't
      mutate a class' __dict__ directly;  use setattr(klass, name, value)
      instead).

CMF 1.4.2 (2003/10/27)

  Bug Fixes

    - CMFDefault RegistrationTool:  enforced using the member's e-mail
      address, rather than the one passed in from the request.

    - CMFCore MembershipTool: Fixed 'getCandidateLocalRoles()'.
      Didn't work without having 'Member' role. (Collector #148 and #169)

    - CMFCore MembershipTool: Changed the permission for searchMembers to
      'List portal members'. By default Anonymous users are no longer able to
      list member ids and email addresses. (Collector #189)

CMF 1.4.1 (2003/09/08)

  Bug Fixes

    - Initialize class security correctly on ActionProviderBase
      (Collector #186).

    - Filesystem-based scripts should open their files in text mode, not
      binary (Collector #185).

    - Remove ownership from filesystem-based skin methods, which
      can't be trojaned, and therefore need not pay the performance
      penalty of ownership checking.

    - CMFCore/MembershipTool.py:  include traceback in log messages
      for errors during 'wrapUser'.

    - CMFDefault/skins: Fix permission name and html in roster.

    - CMFCore/TypesTool.py: Make sure oldstyle FactoryTypeInformation
      data is always converted.  Actions are now completely migrated during
      TypeInformation creation.

    - CMFCore/utils.py: Fix buglet in 'minimalpath()', which caused
      proudct lookup to fail when a second 'Products' directory was
      in the path.

    - CMFCore/Skinnable.py: Fix acquisition wrapping so that getPhysicalPath
      is not spoofed during funny traversals.

    - CMFCore/TypesTool.py:  Fix ownership of constructor scripts used by
      ScriptableTypeInformation (Collector #165).

    - CMFDefault/skins: Fix some minor template issues in ZPT skins
      (Collector #156 and other).

    - CMFDefault and CMFCalendar skins: Fix stylesheets (Collector #164).

    - CMFCalendar:  fix bug in month-spanning events (patch from Helge
      Tesdal).

    - CMFCore and CMFDefault MembershipTool: Make sure 'createMemberarea()'
      always grants the right Ownership and Owner role for new member folders.
      This doesn't fix existing member folders with wrong Owner roles.
      If you use a customized MembershipTool, make sure your createMemberarea
      method does the Right Thing.
      (Collector #162)

CMF 1.4 (2003/05/19)

  Bug Fixes

    - The memberdata tool now fetches properties from member objects using
      'getProperty' when returning search results, rather than performing
      direct attribute access on the member.

    - The CookieCrumber now functions for HEAD requests.

    - type actions: They are now absolute URLs by default.
      For 'getActionById' and '_getViewFor' they are converted to relative
      URLs. (Collector #152)

CMF 1.4beta1 (2003/04/28)

  New Features

    - Made TypeInformation objects derive from CMFCore.ActionProviderBase:
      their actions are now TALES expressions, and they have conditions
      (like all the "tool actions").

    - zpt skins (CMFDefault): Added i18n attributes.
      See INSTALL.txt for installing internationalization support.
      (Collector #122, thanks to Gitte Wange for her contribution)

    - zpt skins (CMFDefault): Added 'zpt_content/transition_form.pt'.
      'content_*_form.pt' now use this template.

    - skins (CMFDefault): Made scripts independent of submit button 'values'.

    - Added .css to the extensions that create FSFile objects in
      DirectoryViews (see CMFCore/FSFile.py)
      All sites upgrading which expected css extension to be dropped and to
      contain DTML will be required to rename their css files to foo.dtml.
      (Collector #129)

    - Added .js to the extensions that create FSFile objects in
      DirectoryViews

    - MembershipTool (CMFDefault): Un-hardwired members folder.
      You now can get the members folder object using 'getMembersFolder()'.
      If you want to change the id of the members folder, rename the folder
      and set the members folder using portal_membership's configuration tab.
      (Collector #128)

    - utils: Changed behavior of 'bodyfinder' and 'html_headcheck'.
      The head check in html_headcheck is now a bit different, but the result
      should be closer to what people expect.
      The head check in bodyfinder is removed. In most cases you want to call
      bodyfinder only if html_headcheck is true.

    - Added FSFile skin object, in order to allow .swf files (et al.) in
      skins

    - Added 'listMetaTags' skin method, which filters the DublinCore
      metadata into a form suitable for inclusion as <meta> tags.

    - Added .metadata file for FSObjects, which allows the easy addition of
      more features without adding lots and lots of files. ConfigParser format.

    - Added proxy roles to FS Python Scripts and FS DTML Methods via the proxy
      property in .metadata files.

  Bug Fixes

    - utils: Changed behavior of 'StrippingParser' and 'scrubHTML'.
      They now close empty tags.
      (Collector #108, thanks to 'tanghus' for the patch)

    - Removed deprecated 'register' module and 'PortalContentRegistration'
      interface.

    - Moved URLTool to CMFCore. Added interface and basic tests.
      (Collector #67)

    - Protected the Pending review action in DefaultWorkflow by
      ReviewPortalContent (Collector #52).

    - Raise ValueError instead of TypeError in TypesTool.getActionById
      if the action is not found (Collector #56).

    - Cleaned up Interfaces and API Help (Collector #96):

      o Removed redundant 'Syndicatable' and 'IndexableContent' interfaces.

      o Removed unfixable 'Membership' and 'ReviewableContent' interfaces.

      o Removed listActions() from 'Contentish' and 'portal_workflow'
        interface.

      o Removed redundant or 'None' overriding of listActions().

      o Updated all interfaces to work with new Zope 2.6 Interface API.

      o Added 'portal_properties' and 'Dynamic' interfaces.

      o Added many interface implementation tests and made them pass.

    - MembershipTool (CMFDefault): Fixed acquisition bug. (Collector #102)

    - Skinnable: Changed docstring for setupCurrentSkin and added
      docstring to changeSkin: the latter is now used to set skin
      manually mid-request. (Collector #27)

    - Document: Ensured that setFormat('text/plain') does not overwrite
      text_format if text_format is 'plain'. (Collector #140)

    - Action providers: Default _actions' are now tuples, not lists.
      (Collector #123)

    - Document: Ensured that 'edit()' and 'PUT()' strip of xhtml headers and
      html headers including DOCTYPE declarations. (Collector #41)

    - Fixed some minor buglets. (Collector #80, #94 and #95)

    - Ensure that a couple of calls to string.split only split into a
      maximum of two parts.
      (Collector #82)

    - Enabled the CMF to be installed in a PRODUCTS_PATH.
      In doing so, also made it easier to move CMF sites between
      Windows and Unix.
      (Collector #64)

    - Multimodule checkin to convert calls from user.getUserName() to
      user.getId() where appropriate.  User names should not be used
      as immutable references, while user ids should.  The distinction
      is not clearly enforcd in the stock user folder or any current user
      folder implementations, but newer user folder implementations
      will rely upon it.

    - Remove redundant VERSION.txt files;  the canonical spelling is
      'version.txt' (Collector #13).

    - Correct security assertion on CMFDefault.Image's manage_afterAdd
      (Collector #141).

    - Ensure that the security attributes are reindexed on all
      subobjects too when a folderish object changes state in the
      workflow (Collector #115).

    - Backport fix of CMFCore/tests/test_FSImage.py to work with
      recent Zopes (> 2.6), which force HTTP headers to be strings.

    - Use return instead of raise in RegistrationTool.testPropertiesValidity
      if id is incorrect (Collector #48).

    - Correctly cleanup temporaries in CMFCore.MemberDataTool when
      wrapping a user object (Collector #136).
