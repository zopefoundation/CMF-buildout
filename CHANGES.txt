1.3.1beta1

  New Features

    - Implemented PUT and GET support to CMFCalendar.Event for
      editing via FTP/WebDAV (thanks to Sidnei da Silva).

  Bug Fixes

    - Fixed incorrect security declaration in File.py (Collector #91).

    - Remove over-helpful default argument values in
      'CMFDefault.DefaultDublinCoreImpl._editMetadata'.  Now, if
      called without a value for an argument, the method will not
      change that value.  Collector #10.

    - Remove workaround in CMFCore.utils for recognizing links in
      StructuredText:  STX in CMF content should now recognize exactly
      the same links as the underlying Zope.  Note that we *do* still
      provide a customized HTML class, to permit embedding images without
      generating the "whole" page.  Collector #6.

    - Remove bizarre, shadowing import of CMFCore.utils as 'utils'
      into package namespace of CMFDefault;  instead, import specific
      names from that package directly (thanks to Paul Winkler for
      pointing out the incongruity).

    - Fix (theoretical) bug in CMFCore.DirectoryView which allowed
      non-registered directories to slip through (UI didn't exercise it).

    - Merge Christian Theune's fix for funky default argument values on
      CMFCalendar.Event's constructor and edit methods (collector #76).

    - FSPageTemplates overwrote a user-generated 'Content-Type' header.
      We now check to make sure a Content-Type header is not already set
      before allowing a page template to set its own.

    - Fixed bugs around 'addActionProvider' in ActionsTool (Collector #42).

    - Fixed race condition in lazy initialization of filesystem-based skin
      methods;  the bug led to odd name errors on 'context' for
      FSPythonScripts (Collector #37).

    - Removed crufty 'isDesktop' stuff from 'folder_factories' and
      'folder_contents' methods.

    - Fixed HTML-invalidating call to 'filterCookie' in 'folder_contents'.
    
    - Fixed unclosed 'tr' element  in ZPT version of 'folder_edit_form'
      (Collector #57).

    - Fixed CalendarTool to use portal_type and not Type to search for
      events in the catalog (Collector #28, thanks to Heimo Laukkanen
      for the report).

    - Fixed a bug in CalendarTool where events were not showing on the
      last day of the month.

CMF 1.3

  New Features
  
    - FSPageTemplates now autodetect XML if a document has the standard
      '&lt;?xml version="xx"?&gt;' at the top, setting the content_type to
      "text/xml" so that it is parsed and served as XML.

    - Added a 'Workflows' tab in the ZMI that displays the workflow
      state of the object.

    - Wired 'scrubHTML' check into default versions of 'document_edit'
      and 'newsitem_edit' skins (site managers who prefer to allow
      JavaScript in content can customize to remove the check).

    - Added utility methods for checking / scrubbing HTML content of
      unwanted tags:  

      CMFDefault.utils:  scrubHTML, isHTMLSafe

      Known bad tags ('script', 'applet', 'embed', 'object'),
      attributes (starting with 'on'), and values (starting with
      'javascript:') cause 'scrubHTML' to raise an exception;  unknown
      tags are silently dropped.  'isHTMLSafe' returns true if
      'scrubHTML' would not raise an exception on the same text.

    - Exposed useful utility methods to scripting / skinning.

      CMFCore.utils:  getToolByName, cookString, tuplize, format_stx,
        keywordsplitter, normalize, expandpath, minimalpath

      CMFDefault.utils:  formatRFC822Headers, parseHeadersBody,
        semi_split, comma_split, seq_strip, tuplize, bodyfinder,
        html_headcheck.

    - Added two utility functions, 'isHTMLSafe' and 'scrubHTML', to
      CMFDefault utils;  these modules check for / remove undesirable
      tags from textual content.

    - Made public functions of 'CMFCore.utils' and 'CMFDefault.utils'
      available for scripting.

    - Allowed Portal Folders to be discussable.

    - Improved the ActionsTool so that permission checking for actions
      is done in the context of the object for all categories that start
      with 'object' or 'workflow', in the context of the folder for
      those that start with 'folder', and in the context of the portal
      otherwise. This is useful for admin-defined additional categories.

  Bug Fixes

    - Fixed Image and File so that they reindex on PUT.

    - Fixed WorkflowTool so that it doesn't pretend to workflow non-CMF
      objects (Collector #19).

    - Removed redundant block of code from CMFDefault/Link.py (Collector
      #18).

    - Fixed discussion tree display not to embed entire HTML document
      (Collector #17, thanks to Jeffrey Shell for the inspiration).

    - Fixed CookieCrumbler to emit "Basic" and not "basic" auth as per
      HTTP spec (Collector #14, thanks to Simon Eisenmann for the
      report). This fixes some WebDAV locking problems with (rightfully)
      picky clients, like ExternalEditor.

    - Made old ListCriterion instances forward-compatible across earlier
      addition of 'operator' field.

    - Defaulted CMFCore.MembershipTool's createMemberArea flag to true,
      to preserve existing behavior:  member area should be created by
      default on first login (Collector #5).

    - Hardened DefaultDublinCoreImpl's EffectiveDate() and
      ExpirationDate() methods to deal better with older / uninitialzed
      content.

    - Refactored content construction in the Types tool to make
      cataloguing and workflow notification more uniform.

    - Made Undo work again by removing any LF in transaction ids.

    - Made WorkflowTool.updateRoleMappings update security-related
      indexes.

    - Append '/' to links in skin templates to the root of the site, to
      pacify clients which won't send Basic Auth tokens because the path
      doesn't match.

    - Removed the binding of Folder and Topic types to the default
      workflow for newly-created CMFSites (Collector #4).  Note that
      existing sites will still need to remove these bindings manually,
      as indicated in the "Upgrading" section of INSTALL.txt.

    - Updated initial action reported by CMFDefault's DefaultWorkflow:
      was "joined", now "created".

    - Fix 'index_html' template to filter using 'View' permission
      (folders which were not viewable were triggering authentication,
      instead of being skipped).

    - Repair free-form subject entry on 'full_metadata_edit_form' (was
      merging all keywords onto the same line, plus soft-wrapping!).
      Likewise the "Contributors" textarea.

    - Ensured that Link, File, and Image content objects reindex
      themselves after edit (wrapping 'edit' as a WorkflowMethod no
      longer guarantees that).

    - Fixed CMFCalendar's "day view" to accomodate the removal of
      'title' metadata from catalog in favor of 'Title' (thanks to
      Dieter Maurer for pointing this out).

    - Corrected a skins performance optimization (the version as
      released in the beta did not take effect).

CMF 1.3 beta2 (2002/07/07)

  New Features

    - Changed the modification date so that it is updated at reindex
      time and does not rely anymore on bobobase_modification_time. This
      makes export+import of objects not lose the modification date.
      Before exporting objects created with an older CMF version,
      reindex the "modified" index in the catalog (you just have to do
      it once, and only if you need to export objects).

    - Made the workflow tool compute chains using type names, as well as
      instances (Tracker #441).

    - Made the DCWorkflow worklists accept a list of formatted values
      for cataloged variable matches. The separator is a semicolon
       (Tracker #496).

    - Made the security-related indexes of the portal catalog be updated
      for all impacted objects whenever local roles are changed (Tracker
       #494). This feature makes use of the 'path' index.

    - Made 'path' (PathIndex) a standard index inside CMF. When
      upgrading from earlier versions this index will have to be created
      by hand.

    - Enabled "within day" queries for FriendlyDateCriteria E.g.,
      field="modified", value="Now", operation="within_day",
      daterange="old" -> content which was modified "today".  (Tracker
      #474).

    - Made the id of the current user available to old action providers
      (DCWorkflow being a prime example) as 'user_id' (Tracker #495,
      thanks to Luca Olivetti for the patch).

    - Modified the 'standard_error_message' page template to show the
      'error_log_url', if passed in (Zope 2.6 will pass this argument if
      an error log is installed).

    - Extended the metadata tool to permit passing the type name
      directly (e.g., when building a new object, one might need to know
      the allowed subjects before construction).

    - Added a working calendar implementation to the CMFCalendar
      product, which had previously provided only an Event content type.
      Thanks to Andy Dawkins for the work.  Note that we are disabling
      the use of sessions to track calendar selections by default;  you
      can re-enable them by visiting the 'portal_calendar' tool in the
      ZMI.

    - Updated FS-based skin methods to read optional '.security files,
      whcih control the role-permission mappings for each skin method.
      See CMFCore/tests/fake_skins/fake_skin/test4.py.security for an
      example.

  Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed PortalFolder's filtering so that it correctly restricts
      itself to the portal types allowed by the TypesTool (Tracker
      #483).

    - Fixed the TypesTool so that TypeInformation's Title is
      decorrelated from its Id (the old TypeInformation.Type() should
      not be used anymore). The Id is what gets put in the "portal_type"
      attribute of a content object, which one gets at using
      somecontent.getPortalTypeName(). The Title is returned by
      somecontent.Type(). "portal_type" is now indexed, and in most
      cases should be used when doing catalog queries instead of "Type".

    - Provided all default skins (content_hide_form, content_show_form)
      for the DCWorkflow default workflow [rev 2]. Note that, when using
       this workflow, the descriptions in the retract and reject forms
       are slightly incorrect as they mention the "private" state but in
       fact go to the "visible" state.

    - Fixed verification of portal types in the TypesTool to work in the
      presence of portal types with a non-empty title (Tracker #497).

    - Removed unintentional sharing of ActionInformation data between
      class defaults and persistent instances derived from
      ActionProviderBase.  Likewise for TypeInformation instances.

    - Enabled creation of "My Stuff" folder for users (e.g., the
      manager) authenticated "above" the normal user folder (Tracker
      #485, thanks to Dieter Maurer for the patch).

    - Fixed handling of discussion items so that they are correctly
      indexed, unindexed and reinserted into the workflows when copied
      or moved.

    - Correctly reindex the just-reset workflow variables of an object
      in a DCWorkflow after a paste.

    - Correctly insert into the workflows the objects created by a
      Scriptable Type.

    - Fixed Friendly Date Criterion edit form to correctly display the
      duration in its menu (Tracker #475, thanks to Axel Joester for the
      patch).

    - Fixed relative URL in metadata_edit_form that broke if the
      main_template had a base tag (Tracker #506).

    - Made discussion replies work correctly when hitting Enter in the
      title field (Tracker #515), and corrected discussion Preview
      followed by an Edit that lost body information (Tracker #516).

    - Fixed the deletion of replies (Tracker #513, thanks to Stefan H.
      Holek for the patch).

    - Made the Link objects deal correctly with empty remote urls
      (Tracker #507) and not strip trailing slashes (Tracker #451).

    - Made content_type_registry deal correctly with TypeInfos that have
      a title (Tracker #465, thanks to Juan Antonio Valiño García for
      the patch).

    - Changed CMFDefault.MembershipTool not to create a member folder at
      member creation time when the memberareaCreationFlag is false
      (Tracker #519). Note that any code that depended on the member
      folder being created after addMember will fail, that code should
      call createMemberarea directly if needed.

    - Fixed CMFDefault.RegistrationTool to correctly check the lack of
      'email' property when creating a new member or when checking
      member's properties validity (Tracker #508).

    - Fixed addtoFavorites to correctly add a favorite of someone else's
      document (Tracker #501).

    - Fixed CatalogTool to create a meta_type index; this is needed now
      that ZCatalog doesn't create any default indexes when
      instantiated.

    - Fixed recent_news to use 'Title' instead of 'title' to display the
      title of each news ('title' isn't indexed anymore).

    - Fixed listFolderContents to take into account its optional 'spec'
      argument.

    - Fixed index_html to correctly filter out unauthorized subfolders
      (Tracker #503).

    - Fixed exception handling to not use a string exception in
      PortalFolder (Tracker #512).

    - Changed the permission protecting the "Join" action provided by
      the default registration tool from "View" to "Add portal member"
      (Tracker #509).

    - Removed redundant "Syndication" action from SkinnedFolder; the
      SyndicationTool provides this aciton. (Tracker #481)

    - Updated INSTALL.txt to note the dependency of CMF on the TAL and
      ZTUtils packages and on the PageTemplates product for Zopes < 2.5.
      (Tracker #489).

    - Updated CatalogTool to create a Vocabulary if none present (as
      won't be for catalogs created under Zope 2.6).

    - Adapted interface checks to work with new spellings in Zope 2.6
      (older Zopes should still work).

    - Removed '##bind' headers from FSPythonScripts where they only
      repeat the defaults.

    - Corrected patterns used for "HTML body stripping" to avoid HTML
      embedded within structured text.

    - Fixed computed action of form in 'folder_rename_form' (Tracker
      #511; thanks to "yuppie" for the patch).

    - Improved cacheability of skin images by using absolute URLs.

    - Suppressed repeated load of FSImage content from filesystem
      (should only happen when in debug mode).

    - Repaired skin methods' read of '.properties' files, which hold
      additional metadata about the skin method beyond what can be
      expressed in the body.

    - Updated caching policy manager tool to use correct date format
      (RFC 1123 instead of RFC 822).

CMF 1.3 beta 1 (2001/04/03)

  New Features

    - CMFDefault Documents, News Items and Discussion Items now support
      a 'plain' text format, which simply HTML-quote's the text before
      displaying it.

    - Added CachingPolicyManager tool, which manages caching policies
      for skin methods, and updated FSPageTemplate to use a CPM if
       found.

    - Added functionality such that only users who have the view
      permission on the relevent Type object can create content of that
      type.

    - Added the ability to limit what types of object an object of a
      given Portal Type can be created in. 

      If 'Implicity Addable' is set (the default), then objects of that
      Type can be added anywhere.

      If it is not set, then objects of that Type can only be added to
      objects whose Type's allowed_content_types contains the Type.

    - Enabled querying actions from workflow tool in absence of actions
      tool (Tracker #401).

    - Added 'operator' attribute to CMFTopic.ListCriterion, to permit
      specifying an operator ('and', for the most part) for indexes
      which support it, e.g., KeywordIndex (Tracker #442).

    - Added ZMI interface for editing Link URL (Tracker #364).

  Bugs Fixed

    - Make ZMI editing of NewsItems safe (Tracker #472).

    - Made generated home pages for new members participate fully in
      workflow (Tracker #467).

    - Added 'text_format' widget to NewsItem's edit forms (Tracker
      #460).

    - Fix sharing bug pointed out by Dieter Maurer (Tracker #484) in
      ActionProviderBase.  Thanks for the patch!

    - Added forwared-compatibility for "old" content (pre CMF 1.0!;
      Tracker #454, thanks to Lucas Hofman for the patch).

    - Made 'PortalFolder.invokeFactory' enforce the
      'filter_content_types' property of the folder's type information
      object.

    - Added stripping of leading / trailing whitespace from Subject
      keywords (Tracker #479, thanks to Lucas Hofman for the patch!)

    - Gave URL tool explicit __roles__, to enable use in 'nocall:'
      expressions.

    - Turned off auto-expansion of customized FSPageTemplates (Tracker
      #477).  
    - Fixed ActionProvidorBase for the case when no permission is
      specified for an action that is added TTW.

    - Fixed ActionsTool so that duplicate actions are stripped.

    - Caused CMFDefault Portal constructor to strip passed-in id before
      creating a portal object with that id.

    - Allowed the ActionsTool to gracefully handle objects which return
      ActionInformation objects. Thanks to Andy Dawkins for the
      analysis. (Tracker #457)

    - Made workflow Expressions use the correct ModuleImporter so that
      they operate correctly in their restricted environment. Thanks to
      Dieter Maurer for the patch.  (Tracker 463)

    - Fixed incorrent permissions in "pending" state of default
      DCWorkflows. Thanks for Lynn Walton for the report and Florent
      Guillaume for the patch. (Tracker #464)

    - Fixed missing comma that affected manager permission to modify in
      the published state. Thanks to Florent Guillaume for the patch
      (Tracker #459)

    - html_quote'd errors raised by FSPageTemplates. Thanks to Dieter
      Maurer for the patch. (Tracker #462)

    - Fixed typo in zpt_stylesheet.css. Thanks to Florent Guillaume for
      the patch. (Tracker #461)

    - Fixed long standing bug in FSPythonScript where get_size returned
      the incorrect length. This broke editing using EMACS via FTP or
      WebDAV. Thanks to John Glavin at South River Technologies for help
      finding the bug.

    - Reworked functionality added in Tracker #409 which broke the Types
      Tool. (Tracker #458)

    - Fixed bug whereby DirectoryView instances were not noticing some
      of the changes they should when Zope was running in debug mode on
      Windows (Tracker #305)

    - Fixed a bug where the workflow notifyCreated method was called
      during manage_afterAdd in PortalContent, making it possible for
      the notification to occur on the wrong workflow.  The notification
      has moved to the contstructInstance method on the TypesTool after
      the _setPortalTypeName method has been called on the object.

    - Extended TypesTool to permit registration of new TypeInformation
      implementations (Tracker #409, thanks to Jeffrey Shell for the
      work!)

    - Fixed a bug in Favorites.getObject to use restrictedTraverse on
      the portal object.

    - Made all tool-generated actions configurable through-the-web, via
      an "Actions" tab on each tool;  made the list of ActionProviders
      configurable TTW as well.

    - Fixed setting the Link.format to URL_FORMAT so the initially
      returned metadata headers would return 'text/url' properly.  Added
      unittests.

    - Enabled querying actions from workflow tool in absence of actions
      tool (Tracker #401).

    - Fixed CMFDefault.utils.parseHeadersBody to properly handle the
      headers generated on a windows app (i.e. Dreamweaver) with /r/n;
      added the compiled regular expression object to the method
      signature.

    - Added full webdav sipport code to Link.py.  Changed _writeFromPUT
      to call _editMetadata instead of editMetadata.

    - Made links emitted by 'topic_view' play nice with virtual hosting
      (Tracker #433).

    - Cleaned up emission of RFC822-style headers (Tracker #407),
      terminating headers must be terminated with CRLF, and padding
      continuation lines (for values with embedded newlines) with
      leading whitespace).

    - Ensure that package initialization files are non-empty, to prevent
      suspicion that they were corrupted in download (Tracker #426).

    - Added external method update_catalogIndexes.py to run as part of a
      upgrade to CMFs migrating to Zope2.4+ from from CMF sites which
      were built using Zope2.3 catalog

    - Use ID to label Favorite when target has an empty Title (Tracker
      #440).

    - Allowed sub-folders to have different syndication properties than
      parents (Tracker #421).

    - Added 'CMFDefault.Upgrade.upgrade_decor_skins' external method to
      convert existing sites which had installed skin directories from
      the now-deprecated 'CMFDecor' product (Tracker #434).  Added note
      explaining the issue, and the workaround, to 'ISSUES.txt'.

    - Ensure that Favorites display the correct, absolute URL to their
      target, without needing to have 'base' tag set (Tracker #419).

    - Worked around Opera's strange insistence on selecting an option,
      even for multi-select lists (Tracker #332).

    - Hardened CMFCore to initialize correctly in the absence of the
      PageTemplates product (Tracker #430).

    - Restored slot in 'head' of ZPT main template into which content
      can insert the 'base' tag (Tracker #418).

    - Fixed 'CMFTopic.SimpleIntegerCriterion.edit' to require a pair of
      values when 'direction' is 'min:max';  updated skins to use new
      'getValueString', which renders such values properly (Tracker
      #439).

    - Ensured that Documents created with initial STX get cooked
      (Tracker #435).

    - Made links emitted by 'topic_view' play nice with virtual hosting
      (Tracker #433).

    - Made 'CMFCore/interfaces/__init__.py' non-empty, to remove
      suspicion that the file was corrupted in the download (Tracker
      #426).
