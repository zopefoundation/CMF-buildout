CMFCalendar README

  The CMFCalendar product is an example of creating a CMF
  Product.  The CMFCalendar product is also expected to be a
  generally useful out of the 'box' and skinnable to accomodate
  customization within your existing CMF instance.  To see how to
  go about building a CMF product, this hopefully allows a
  developer to follow through the process of registering their
  product, skins, and help with the CMF by example.  It shows how
  an object is created and registered with the types_tool,
  necessary skins added to the skins_tool, with the Calendar
  skins directory added to the skin paths, and providing
  portal_metadatool with an Element policy for the content_type
  of the object.

  At the time of this writing, this product is incomplete.  The
  event is complete, and can stand alone, but will be
  accompanyied by the CMFCalendar in the next release.  We wished
  to get something out quickly, so we'll be living by the axiom:
  'Release early; Release often' until all it's components are
  completed.

  See the INSTALL.txt file for how to get the product installed
  within your CMF.
