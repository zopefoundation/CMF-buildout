<h3> <code>portal_actions</code> Tool </h3>

<p> This tool assembles the "actions" which are germane to the current
    user (anonymous, member, etc.) and context (content object or folder
    being viewed).  These actions are drawn from several sources:

    <ul>
      <li> the actions tool itself, for "global" actions (optional);</li>
      <li> the workflow tool, for actions which depend on the
           workflow state of the content object (optional);</li>
      <li> the membership tool, for actions which depend on the
           member or user (optional);</li>
      <li> the types tool, for actions which are specific to a given
           content type (hardwired);</li>
      <li> other action providers (optional).</li>
    </ul>
