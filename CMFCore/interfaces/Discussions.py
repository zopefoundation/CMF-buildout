        This method determines where a user's reply should be stored, and
        what it's ID should be.

        You don't really want to force users to have to select a
        unique ID each time they want to reply to something.  The
        present implementation selects a folder in the Member's home
        folder called 'Correspondence' (creating it if it is missing)
        and finds a free ID in that folder.

        createReply should use this method to determine what the reply
        it creates should be called, and where it should be placed.

        This method (and createReply, I expect) do not really belong in
        this interface.  There should be a DiscussionManager singleton
        (probably the portal object itself) which handles this.
