"Correspondent Adds Note to an Issue" Use Case

  Actors

    - Correspondent (may be a Submitter or on of the tracker
      owners)

  Goal

    - Add a comment which illustrates or helps in the resolution
      of an "in-work" issue.

  Preconditions

    - Correspondent is authenticated WRT the CMFSite.

    - or more issues has already been
      "accepted":../SupporterAcceptsIssue.stx by one or more
      Supporters into a tracker.
    
    - Correspondent is authorized to add content to an issue
      within a given tracker (has either "Submitter" or "Owner"
      role WRT the issue).

  Main Flow

    1. Correspondent either receives notification of (e.g., via a
       nightly email) or browses to (e.g., via a slashbox) the
       list of issues in which she is involved, either as the
       Submitter or as a Supporter.

       System displays a summary listing of all issues which are
       in a "non-closed" state (e.g., "pending acceptance", "in
       work", "pending verification", etc.);  these issues are
       filtered such that those requiring action by Correspondent
       (based on their state, and Correspondent's roles), are
       grouped at the top of the list;  others group to the
       bottom.

    2. Correspondent clicks through to an issue, and selects its
       "Reply" action.

       System prompts for the reply, which may reference other
       content objects via standard HTML/STX linking.

    3. Correspondent fills out the reply and submits it.
       System creates a DiscussionItem within the issue, using the
       data supplied by Correspondent.
       
       System "notifies":../NotificationStrategy.stx all of the
       issue's Correspondents of the new reply.
