"Submitter Requests Issue Resolution" Use Case

  Actors

    - Submitter

  Goal

    - Request that an issue be resolved by the team assigned to
      its category.

  Preconditions

    - Submitter is authenticated WRT the CMFSite in which she
      wishes to create an issue.
      
    - Submitter has previously "created an
      IssueDescription":../SubmitterDescribesIssue.stx in the
      location where she is browsing the site, and now desires
      to submit it to the group who will evaluate and resolve it.

  Main Flow

    1. Submitter browses to an existing IssueDescription object
       for which she has "Owner" local role.

    2. After reviewing the issue, Submitter selects its "Submit"
       action.  The system prompts Submitter to designate the
       "target" Tracker (if this designation has not already been
       made);  it then "logs a workflow
       transition":../WorkflowTransitionLogging.stx to the
       "Pending Review" state, and catalogs it such that the
       owners of the target Tracker are
       "notified":../NotificationStrategy.stx of its submission.

       At this point, the IssueDescription is not generally
       "discussable" (although workflow transitions can create
       replies);  nor is the issue "public" while in this
       "pupal" phase.
