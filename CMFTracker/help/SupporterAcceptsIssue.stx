"Supporter Accepts Issue" Use Case

  Actors

    - Supporter

  Goal

    - Take responsibility for an issue submitted to a given
      tracker.

  Preconditions

    - Supporter is authenticated WRT the CMFSite, and is
      authorized to accept issues into a tracker.

    - One or more issues has already been
      "created":../SubmitterDescribesIssue.stx and
      "submitted":../SubmitterRequestsResolution.stx to that
      tracker.

  Main Flow

    1. Supporter receives notification that one or more issues
       are pending against a tracker for which she is
       responsible (e.g., by email, or by a topic-like slashbox).
       Supporter browses to that tracker and selects the "Review
       pending issues" action.

       System displays a summary listing of all issues which are
       in "pending acceptance" state.

    2. Supporter clicks through to an issue, reviewing it, and
       selects the "Accept" action.

       System prompts for a log message.

    3. Supporter supplies the log message and confirms acceptance.

       System **moves the accepted issue into the tracker**,
       renaming it and readjusting ownership and role mappings to
       accomodate the "tracker issue lifecycle":../Lifecycle.stx.
       In its original place, system creates a TrackerTicket, a
       Favorite-based pointer to the newly-moved Issue.  Supporter
       becomes the new owner of the issue;  Submitter retains
       "Submitter" local role.

       System "notifies":../NotificationStrategy.stx Submitter and
       tracker owners of the acceptance of the issue.

       At this point, the issue becomes
       "discussable":../CorrespondentAddsNote.stx by both the
       submitter and by the owners of the tracker into which it
       has been accepted.
