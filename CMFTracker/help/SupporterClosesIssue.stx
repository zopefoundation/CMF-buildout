"Supporter Closes Issue" Use Case

  Actors

    - Supporter

  Goal

    - Mark an issue submitted to a given group as "closed".

  Preconditions

    - Supporter is authenticated WRT the CMFSite, and is
      assigned to a tracker.

    - One or more issues has already been
      "accepted":../SupporterAcceptsIssue.stx by a supporter.

  Main Flow

    1. Supporter either receives notification of (e.g., via a
       nightly email) or browses to (e.g., via a slashbox) the
       list of issues for which she is responsible.

       System displays a summary listing of all issues which are
       in a "non-closed" state (e.g., "pending acceptance", "in
       work", "pending verification", etc.);  these issues are
       filtered such that those requiring action by Correspondent
       (based on their state, and Correspondent's roles), are
       grouped at the top of the list;  others group to the
       bottom.

    2. Supporter clicks through to an issue, reviewing it, and
       selects one of the "terminal" actions ("Resolve", "Defer",
       "Divert", "Reject").

       System prompts for a log message.

    3. Supporter supplies the log message an confirms the action.

       System updates the issue, notifying all involved
       correspondents that it has been closed.  At this point,
       no further "discussion":../CorrespondentAddsNote.stx of
       the item is possible.
