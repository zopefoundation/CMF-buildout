"Supporter Redirects Issue" Use Case

  Actors

    - Supporter

  Goal

    - Assign issues submitted to the wrong tracker to a more
      appropriate one.

  Preconditions

    - Supporter is authenticated WRT the CMFSite, and is
      authorized to accept issues into a tracker.

    - One or more issues has already been
      "created":../SubmitterDescribesIssue.stx and
      "submitted":../SubmitterRequestsResolution.stx to that
      tracker.

  Main Flow

    1. Supporter receives notification that one or more issues
       are pending against a tracker for which she is
       responsible (e.g., by email, or by a topic-like slashbox).
       Supporter browses to that tracker and selects the "Review
       pending issues" action.

       System displays a summary listing of all issues which are
       in "pending acceptance" state.

    2. Supporter clicks through to an issue, reviewing it;
       determining that it would be more appropriately submitted
       to another tracker, Supporter selects its "Redirect" action.

       System prompts for a log message and for the new target
       tracker.

    3. Supporter selects the new target, supplies the log message
       and confirms the redirect.

       System "logs a workflow
       transition":../WorkflowTransitionLogging.stx to the
       "Pending Review" state, and catalogs it such that the
       owners of the new target Tracker are
       "notified":../NotificationStrategy.stx of its submission.
       (Submitter and "old" target tracker owners should be
       notified, as well).
