"Supporter Rejects Issue" Use Case

  Actors

    - Supporter

  Goal

    - Reject submitted issues which are not "well-formed", or for
      which the target tracker's owners are not responsible.

  Preconditions

    - Supporter is authenticated WRT the CMFSite, and is
      authorized to accept issues into a tracker.

    - One or more issues has already been
      "created":../SubmitterDescribesIssue.stx and
      "submitted":../SubmitterRequestsResolution.stx to that
      tracker.

  Main Flow

    1. Supporter receives notification that one or more issues
       are pending against a tracker for which she is
       responsible (e.g., by email, or by a topic-like slashbox).
       Supporter browses to that tracker and selects the "Review
       pending issues" action.

       System displays a summary listing of all issues which are
       in "pending acceptance" state.

    2. Supporter clicks through to an issue, reviewing it, and
       selects its "Reject" action.

       System prompts for a log message.

    3. Supporter supplies the log message an confirms rejection.

       System logs a "workflow
       transition":../WorkflowTransitionLogging.stx to the
       "Private" state.

       System "notifies":../NotificationStrategy.stx Submitter
       and tracker owners of the rejection of the issue.
