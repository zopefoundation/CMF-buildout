"""
This file is an installation script for CMFWiki.  It's meant to be
used as an External Method.  To use, add an external method to the
root of the CMF Site that you want CMF Wiki registered in with the
configuration:

 id: install_cmfwiki
 title: Install CMFWiki *optional*
 module name: CMFWiki.Install
 function name: install

Then go to the management screen for the newly added external method
and click the 'Try it' tab.  The install function will execute and give
information about the steps it took to register and install the CMF Wiki
into the CMF Site instance.
