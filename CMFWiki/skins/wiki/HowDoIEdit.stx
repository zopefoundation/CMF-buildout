<h3>How do I edit ?</h3>
<p>  <font size=-1>See HowDoINavigate for navigation instructions.</font></p>

<p>  Click "Edit this page" at the bottom of any page where you're
  allowed.  If you're not allowed to edit, you may be allowed to
  comment - see <a href="#commenting">below</a> for details.  (See
  "RegulatingYourPages":RegulatingYourPages for info about who's allowed
  to do what.)  The SandBox is a good place to practice editing and
  creating pages.</p>

<p>  ZWiki text is designed to be easy to edit and read in its raw form,
  while retaining the benefits of fancy formatting, document structure,
  linking, and all the other great features of web presentation.  
  "TextFormattingRules":TextFormattingRules goes into the essentials
  of this formatting.</p>

<p>  The edit form has a slot for a brief log message, to convey the
  essence of your changes.  The current page log message is shown on
  the "RecentChanges" page, conveying at a glance what the last change
  is.  The log message also shows in the page history and manager's
  undo views - they can help substantially to orient people, and are
  worth filling in.</p>

<p>  <a name="commenting"></a>
  Some pages are set by their owners to allow commenting, rather than,
  or in addition to, editing.  The comments are appended to the ends
  of the pages, along with the commentor's id and the date.  The
  comment form includes a copy of the page with every line prefixed by
  ">", ripe for citing by copying into the comment area.  The ">"
  prefixed comment lines are automatically treated as preformatted
  regions, exempt from text flowing and other wiki-page processing.</p>


<h3>How do I link and create new pages ?</h3>
<p>  To create a link to another wiki page, just write a WikiName.
  (Alternately, you can create wiki links by enclosing arbitrary
  phrases in <code>[square brackets]</code> - but that can create
  hard-to-remember names with hard-to-type URLs.  WikiNames (see
  "WikiName":WikiName) are the vocabulary of the wiki - it's a Good Thing
  to have them regular and recognizable in-and-of themselves.)</p>

<p>  If the page does not yet exist, and you're allowed to create pages
  from the current page, a <strong>?</strong> will be displayed - click it to
  create the new page.  This is how new wiki pages are added.</p>

<p>  To link to a page on another site, just type the url. Or, you can
  use HTML.  Also, "RemoteWikiLinks":RemoteWikiLinks are a convenient
  notation for linking to pages on another site.</p>

<p>  When you're <em>not</em> allowed to create new pages from that spot
  (again, see "RegulatingYourPages":RegulatingYourPages), you will see
  <strong><sup>x</sup></strong> by the
  potential wiki link.  Following that link will bring you to the
  source of the current page - once again, see 
  "RegulatingYourPages":RegulatingYourPages for info about who's allowed 
  to do what.</p>

<h3>What if I make a mistake ?</h3>
<p>  If some good text gets lost by mistake, you might find it by backing
  up in your browser - copy and paste back it into the page.  If you
  successfully commit your edits, but <em>they're</em> incorrect, you can use 
  the history mechanism to refer back to previous versions of the page 
  to recover old text, and/or bring an entire copy of an old page into 
  the present.  See the history link in the footer at the bottom of
  every page, or the <code>edited</code> link at the very top.</p>

<p>  If all that fails, the site admin may be able to help undo the changes.
