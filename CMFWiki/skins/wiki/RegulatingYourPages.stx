<h3>Specifying Who Can Do What in Your Wiki Pages and Folders</h3>
<p>  Wiki page and folder owners can specify which visitors to their
  pages can do what wiki operations with them.  The regulations are
  expressed according to operation versus role categories, or versus
  specific user ids.</p>

<p>  Every page has a regulations form with controls for the page - only
  the page or folder owners, or Managers, can change the settings, but
  anyone can view them.  See these settings by following the "Advanced
  Actions" link in the page footer.</p>

<p>  The following table describes the terms used in the controls.  It's
  followed by descriptions of some ways the controls are used for
  common community scenarios.</p>

<p>  <table cellspacing=20>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
        <table border=1>
          <tr>
            <th colspan=2 bgcolor="eeeeee"> Operations </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th align="left" valign="top"> Create </th>
            <td>
              Enable people to create pages for new wiki names.  They
              will be presented with a <font color="green"> <strong>?</strong> </font> 
              question mark to create a new page with the current page
              as its parent.  Those not allowed to create new pages
              from the current page will see an
              <font color="green"> <strong><sup>x</sup></strong> </font>
              instead.
            </td>
          </tr> <tr>
            <th align="left" valign="top"> Edit </th> <td>
              Change the text of the current page.
            </td>
          </tr> <tr>
            <th align="left" valign="top"> Comment </th> <td>
              Append comments to the bottom of the page.  This is a
              more controlled way to get feedback than the more
              free-wheeling full-edit ability.
            </td>
          </tr> <tr>
            <th align="left" valign="top"> Move </th> <td>
              Rename or delete the page, or change its designated
              parent(s).  When renaming, links to the old name will
              <em> not </em> be automatically adjusted to track
              change.

            <td>
              The fundamental category, users with the <code>Owner</code> role
              for the page.  Those owners and a few other people -
              those with Manager role and owners of the folder - can
              also set page regulations, establishing which page
              visitors can do what on the pages.

              This category further extends to include <em>any</em> logged-in visitor.

              Indistinguishable from one another, there's no way to
              assign responsibility for their actions - which may
              sometimes be your aim.
