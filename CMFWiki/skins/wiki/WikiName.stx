<p>Wiki page names are usually two or more Capitalized Words - run
together: WikiName.</p>

<p>The result is distinctive enough to be recognizable by the software,
yet still readable by people - and much easier to type than an html
hyperlink.</p>

<p>Smooshing together words makes for more regular choices than
wide-open, whitespace-containing text phrases.  The idea is that the
WikiName is easier to remember and more likely to be reinvented the
same by different people - promoting easier collaboration.</p>

<p>In the abstract, WikiNames are the terms which embody the wiki's
topic.</p>

<p>The ZWiki version of WikiName can include "~" tildes as if they were
lowercase letters, and numbers as if they were uppercase letters - but
neither may occur at the beginning of the name.  So, <code>Zope2</code> and
<code>AFL~CIO</code> are valid [WikiName]s.</p>
