<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>  This is the CMFWiki version of a "WikiWikiWeb":WikiWikiWeb, which is a
  kind of collaborative website.  Wikis try to put as little as possible in
  the way of people sharing useful content in a manageable way.</p>

<p>  If you're allowed to edit a page, you can change it on the spot by
  clicking "Edit this page".  You may be also able to add comments to
  the bottom of the page.  In either case, intuitive
  "TextFormattingRules":TextFormattingRules are followed to simplify the
  process of writing and linking pages.</p>

<p>  The idea is to keep the text that people edit simple, so it's
  readable as is, and, most importantly, editable by anyone, without
  sacrificing niceness of the formatted presentation.</p>
