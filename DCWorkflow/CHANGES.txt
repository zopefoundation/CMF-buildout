Version 0.3

- Fixed guard expressions.  Thanks to Jens Quade!

- Implemented updateRoleMappingsFor(), a new addition to the
WorkflowDefinition interface.

- Added getPortal() to the expression namespace.  Again, thanks to Jens
Quade.

- DCWorkflow is now aware of ObjectDeleted and ObjectMoved messages.
 
- getObjectContainer() added to expressions.
 
- What is passed to scripts is now an object whose attributes are from
  the expression namespace.

Version 0.2

- As suggested by Seb Bacon, simplified by making transitions trigger on
their own IDs.  Thanks!
 
- Added script invocation just before execution of a transition.  Scripts
are passed an expression namespace as the first parameter.
 
- Replaced the name "action_or_method" with "transition".

Version 0.1
