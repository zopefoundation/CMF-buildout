Expressions in DCWorkflow use the same convention as DTML expressions.
The underscore character provides access to certain Python modules and
builtins.  In addition to what is provided by DTML expressions, the
following names are also available.

- All scripts defined using the 'Scripts' tab.

- 'object' is the object being modified by workflow.

- 'workflow' is the workflow definition object.

- 'transition' is the ID of the transition being executed.

- 'new_state' is the ID of the destination state of the transition.

- 'kwargs' is the keyword arguments passed to the doActionFor() method.

- 'getHistory()', a function that returns a copy of the object's workflow
   history.

- 'getPortal()', which returns the root of the portal.

- 'getObjectContainer()', which returns the container of the object.

- 'ObjectDeleted' and 'ObjectMoved', exceptions that can be raised by
  scripts to indicate to the workflow that an object has been moved or
  deleted.

- All status variables, including the current state.
