GenericSetup Product Changelog

  After GenericSetup 1.0

    - Added 'for_' argument to profile registry operations.
      A profile may be registered and queried as appropriate to a specific
      site interface;  the default value, 'None', indicates that the profile
      is relevant to any site.  Note that this is essentially an adapter
      lookup;  perhaps we should reimplement it so.

    - Forward ported changes from GenericSetup 0.11 and 0.12 (which were
      created in a separate repository).

    - Don't export or purge read-only properties.

    - Correctly quote XML on export.
