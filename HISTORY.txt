1.0 final (2001/03/29)

 - Removed embedded spaces in 'portal_status_message' strings
   (thanks to Dieter Maurer for pointing this out)

 - Added 'index_html' (copy/paste from CMFCore.PortalContent?!?) so
   that topics become directly publishable (thanks to Dieter
   Maurer for pointing this out).

 - Removed references to 'Images/' in skin DTML, adding an extra
   item to the default skins' lookup path. In CMFDefault/scripts
   you will find 'addImagesToSkinPaths.pys', a Python Script that
   adds the extra name to all your skin paths. (Tracker issue
   #205).

 - Added FSPythonScripts, allowing filesystem-based skins to
   expose customizable PythonScripts.

 - Fixed CMF Tracker item (207), "HTML test when editing a Portal
   Document is ambiguous".  Now, the same regular expression used
   to scoop out the contents of the <body> tags, which is case
   insensitive, is also used to detect whether the document may
   be HTML.

 - Converted physical path to string (Tracker #224).

 - Fixed 'Creator' metadata for DiscussionItems (tracker issue
   #206, thanks to Jeff Sasmor for the patch!).

 - Added simple search field for 'Subject' (Tracker #213).

 - Fixed CMF Tracker issue 211, "Topics have Folder icon" by
   finally moving the Topic icon into the skins, and writing a
   custom icon() method that uses getIcon (Subclassing from
   PortalFolder made this behavior strange).

 - Changed CMFDefault.Document__init__ to call self.edit at the
   end, instead of self._parse, which means that HTML can finally
   be passed into the constructor.  Unit tests verify that
   initializing with just the 'id' gives the proper results.

 - Added installation script (external method) for CMFTopic.

 - Ensured that content metatypes show up in the types list of the
   portal_catalog tool (Tracker issue #209, thanks to Jeff
   Sasmor).

 - Fixed unwanted multiple font reductions on 'recent_news'
   (Tracker issue #215).

 - Changed visited link color to enhance readability.

 - Fixed PNG transparency of logo (for NS 4.7).

 - Allowed Contributors to publish content directly (Tracker
   issue #216).

 - Gave more real estate to skin path fields (Tracker issue
   #226).

 - Added simple listing of subtopics to the default view (Tracker
   issue #214).

 - Regularized DiscussionItem.absolute_url (further work on
   Tracker issues #203 & #206).

 - Made 'addToFavorites' work as skinned method of target, and
   work for DiscussionItems (Tracker issue #227).

 - Moved actual mail sending into CMFDefault.RegistrationTool, to
   avoid having to give proxy roles to the skin methods involved
   (Tracker issue #160).

 - Add member count to roster display.

 - Made 'review_state' workflow info publically visible.

 - Made DiscussionItem.getReplies() and
   DiscussionItemContainter.getReplies() show only 'published'
   replies (allows retraction, for now).

 - Fixed WorkflowAction.__call__ to use the correct method name
   for exception notification (Tracker issue #232).

 - Ensure that reply's Creator propagates through preview (thanks
   to Jeff Sasmor for reporting that our fix to Tracker issue
   #206 missed the "Preview" case).

 - Removed crufty calls to registerPortalContent.

 - Trimmed over-long item IDs in actions box (Tracker issue #
   234;  thanks to Jeff Sasmor and Steve Alexandar for the patch).

1.0 beta (2001/03/05)

 * Migrated from old PTK repository on cvs.zope.org.

 * Changed package and module names:  'PTKBase' has become
   (mostly) 'CMFCore';  'PTKDemo', 'CMFDefault'.

 * Added package 'CMFTopic', which provides a new content type,
   'Topic';  topics are "logical" folders, which aggregate
   content based on catalog searches against metadata.
 
 * Revised discussion mechanism to store discussion with its
   underlying content (rather than in members' "Correspondence"
   folders).

 * Mad the membership system agnostic to the kind of user
   folder, including whether it is found in the portal or not.

 * "Skinned" the portal UI and all the content objects,
   enabling portal managers to replace it "piecemeal", safely.

 * Implemented local type registration, allowing portal
   managers to configure and extend the types addable in the
   portal.

 * Add 'PortalFolder.allowedContentTypes' and supporting machinery
   in type info objects, to permit configuration of the content
   types addable to a given folder type.

0.10alpha (2001/02/02)

 * Fixed breakage of "reply" feature introduced by new
   constructor regime (PTK Tracker #159).

 * Make creation of an 'acl_users' in the portal itself optional.

 * Add mapping of external roles (i.e., belonging to a user
   retrieved from an acquired user folder) onto "portal-specific"
   roles.  For example, users from the root user folder may
   have the "Employee" role;  the 'portal_membership' tool can
   map this role onto the "Member" role needed by the portal.

 * Corrected HTML quoting of Document text (PTK Tracker #154).

 * If content_url is not None and the user has their own member
   folder (as returned by 'portal_membership.getHomeUrl') then
   two new actions will show up in the user-related action box:

   - "Add to Favorites", adds an item to the user's "Favorites"
     folder, which will get created underneath the user's home
     folder if not present.

   - "My Favorites", linked to the Favorites folder (if the
     member has one).

 * Add 'Favorites' content type (derived from 'Link', optimized
   for objects within the same site).

 * Add 'PTKBase.interfaces.Contentish', an interface describing
   non-metadata methods for all content objects.

 * Added cool new portal icon -- thanks to Michael Bernstein!

 * Add 'simple_metadata' and 'metadata_help' methods, for easing
   "constructorish" capture of metadata.  Also demos "skinning"
   object-specific DTML.

 * Rearranged base classes to deal with the fact that SimpleItem
   now has a _setId() method.

 * Added a "quick start" script for creating a new INSTANCE_HOME
   sandbox (e.g., to allow easy experimentation with new-style
   portal).
 
 * Remove "metadata" editing from most "normal" edit forms.

 * Tweak stylesheets to make Netscrape 4.x more happy (links on
   secondary accent areas wouldn't show).

 * Enforced standard construction interface (only 'id' is
   required) on all "stock" content types.

 * Added default factory registration in 'portal_types' for all
   "stock" content types.

 * Add 'portal_types' tool, allowing registry of type / constructor
   information about portal content which may be created in a given
   portal instance (replaces 'Wizards' folder as type registry).

 * Added the description property to those attributes shown on the
   "view" screen for a file object (PTK Tracker #153).

 * Added credentialsChanged hook which can now work with
   CookieCrumblers.

 * Added Shane Hathaway's CookieCrumbler product, which spoofs
   HTTP Basic Auth for "don't know from cookies" user folders.

 * Add object for mapping property lists as filesystem object (to
   support parameterized stylesheet).  These objects are
   customized as normal Folders, which allows a great deal of
   flexibility.

 * Corrected 'PTKDemo.File.edit' to avoid replacing file contents
   with empty string when no file is uploaded (PTK Tracker #152).

 * Remove distribution-tab verisons of TTW products.

 * Remove derived UML model files (UML-HTML).

 * Added the PortalGenerator class, which is a subclassable portal
   instance creator, and created a new addable meta type.

 * Removed ZClass dependency from PropertiesTool.

 * Corrected glitch that 'PTKDemo.PortalObject.manage_options'
   was inherited from ObjectManager rather than PortalFolder.

 * Add 'PUT_factory' to PTKBase.PortalFolder (make it replaceable,
   too!)

 * Register PTKDemo content class metatypes with PTKBase.PortalFolder's
   MIME-type registry.

 * Unscrew PTKDemo.Document's dependence on vanished
   NullPortalResource.

 * Clean up CSS in DemoPortal (PTK Tracker #124).

 * Remove dependency on PythonMethod in DemoPortal (PTK Tracker #151).

 * Integrated user preference for "skin" with 'portal_skins'
   options.

 * Added capability to filter * 'PortalFolder.content{Ids,ValuesItems}'
   based on metadata queries.

 * Migrated skins from 'DemoPortal/Interfaces' folders into
   filesystem skins directories.

 * Improved integration of FSDTMLMethod and FSImage with output from
   the FSDump product.

 * New tab for the member data tool: 'contents' displays the number
   of members stored in the member data tool and also the number
   of "orphaned" members, meaning those that do not appear in the
   underlying acl_users anymore. a button is provided to "prune"
   those orphaned members.

 * Added methods to examine the contents of the meber data tool and to
   prune all those members who have been deleted out of the underlying
   'acl_users'.

 * Fixed bug when adding the mailhost during Portal initialization.

 * Added the portal_memberdata tool, which can wrap any user object with
   member properties.  Yeehaw!  the portal no longer needs a special
   user folder!

 * Add 'portal_skins' tool, enabling safe TTW customization of the default
   portal UI, which will be delivered as filesystem-based skin folders.
   Huge kudos to Shane Hathaway, who figured out a sane way to do this!

 * Extend fix for PTK Tracker #149 to 'generic' and 'sweng' interfaces.

 * Append '/view' to search results in order to allow navigation
  to objects which don't use standard header/footer in their
  'index_html', e.g., Images.  (PTK Tracker Issue #149)

 * Add meta_type to DiscussionItem (PTK Tracker Issue #150).

 * Integrate Dan Pierson's patch to show discussion threads inline
   (PTK Tracker issue #93).

 * Fix PTK Tracker #145 (PTKDemo/Portal.py or MailHost broken):  the
   2000/12/08 hotfix removed the "legacy" name, 'manage_addMailHost'.

 * Fix PTK Tracker #148 ('Table rows need vertical align')

 * Fix PTK Tracker #147 ("PTKDemo's Metadata HTML is ugly").

 * Fix PTK Tracker issue #136 ('CSS selection broken').

 * Fix Tracker issue #141 ('Wizard product has broken subobjects list').

 * Remove redundant 'description' arg from constructors (PTK Tracker
   issue #142;  thanks to jon@totient.demon.co.uk for reporting this).

 * Enable FTP upload/creation of NewsItems

 * Add the ability to query and set DublinCore metadata via FTP:

   - Updated PTKDemo.DemoDublinCore.DemoDublinCore to add a
     method, 'getMetadataHeaders()', which builds a list of
     DublinCore headers, suitable for inclusion in <meta> tags
     or in "Structured Text Headers".  

   - Updated PTKDemo.Document.Document to export/import the
     metadata when accessed via FTP.

 * Fix PortalFolder.all_meta_types() to allow non-content.

 * Fix PortalFolder.listActions() to return a tuple, not a list
