Installing CMF 1.2

  Requirements

    - Zope v. 2.3.3, 2.4.3 or 2.5 and later (*not* 2.4.2 or 2.4.1)

    - Zope PageTemplates

  Assumptions

    - New installation

    - Zope configured using INSTANCE_HOME, /var/zope, and
      SOFTWARE_HOME, /usr/local/zope/Zope-2.3.2

  Procedure

    1. Unpack the CMF-1.2.tar.gz tarball or CMF-1.2.zip file into a working
       directory. For instance::

        $ cd /usr/local/zope
        $ tar xzf /tmp/CMF-1.x.tar.gz

       Note for Windows users:  if you are using WinZip to unpack
          the file, be *sure* to disable the "TAR file smart CR/LF
          expansion" option (thanks to Frank McGeough for tracking
          down this problem!)


    2. Link (or copy/move) the CMF packages into
       $INSTANCE_HOME/Products (or into $SOFTWARE_HOME/lib/python/Products).
       For instance::

        $ cd /var/zope/Products  # /var/zope is INSTANCE_HOME
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.x/CMFCore .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.x/CMFDefault .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.x/CMFTopic .

       or, as a shortcut::

        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.x/CMF* .

       Since linking doesn't apply on Windows, you will need
       to cut or copy the files from the place where you unpacked
       them to the 'Products' directory of your Zope.

    3. Restart Zope; verify that the CMF products loaded
       property, by examining them in Control_Panel/Product.

    4. Create a CMF Site object. join, and begin adding content.
       Enjoy!

    *Note:* --
          CMFDecor has been merged into CMFDefault, it is not longer and
          optional product. It requires that you have
          "Zope Page Templates", http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/ZPT
          installed.

Upgrading from CMF 1.1


  Install the New Software.

    0. "Download":CMF-1.2.tar.gz the tarball.

    1. Copy your "working" products off to one side (in case
       you need / choose to revert).

    2. Unpack the tarball into a separate location; copy or
       link the subdirectories into the 'Products' directory of
       your INSTANCE_HOME.

    3. Restart Zope.

    4.  **Note**

        If your CMF instance was setup to use CMFDecor you will need to Create 
        and run the external method Upgrade.py (upgrade_decor_skins) 
        from the root of your CMF instance to upgrade your skin paths. 
        This fixes breakage due to the merging of CMFDecor into CMFDefault.
