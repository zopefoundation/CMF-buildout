Installing CMF 1.5.0beta

  Requirements

    - Zope v. 2.7.0 and later

  Assumptions

    - New installation

    - Zope configured using INSTANCE_HOME, /var/zope, and
      SOFTWARE_HOME, /usr/local/zope/Zope-2.7.0

  Procedure

    1. Unpack the CMF-1.5.0beta.tar.gz tarball into a working
       directory. For instance::

        $ cd /usr/local/zope
        $ tar xzf /tmp/CMF-1.5.0beta.tar.gz

       Note for Windows users:  if you are using WinZip to unpack
          the file, be *sure* to disable the "TAR file smart CR/LF
          expansion" option (thanks to Frank McGeough for tracking
          down this problem!)


    2. Link (or copy/move) the CMF packages into
       $INSTANCE_HOME/Products (or into $SOFTWARE_HOME/lib/python/Products).
       For instance::

        $ cd /var/zope/Products  # /var/zope is INSTANCE_HOME
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMFCore .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMFDefault .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMFTopic .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMFActionIcons .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMFCalendar .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMFSetup .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMFUid .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/DCWorkflow .

       or, as a shortcut::

        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/CMF* .
        $ ln -s /usr/local/zope/CMF-1.5.0beta/DCWorkflow .

       Since linking doesn't apply on Windows, you will need
       to cut or copy the files from the place where you unpacked
       them to the 'Products' directory of your Zope.

    3. Restart Zope; verify that the CMF products loaded
       property, by examining them in Control_Panel/Product.

    4. Create a CMF Site object. join, and begin adding content.
       Enjoy!

    5. If you want to use CMFCalendar: Build and run the installation
       ExternalMethod as described in CMFCalendar/INSTALL.txt.

      the messages yourself!

  Assumptions

    - CMF is installed as described above.
