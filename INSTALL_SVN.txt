Overview

 This document describes the process of getting the CMF from the Subversion 
 repository, and installing it into your Zope.  It assumes the following:

  * You want to install the "latest-and-greatest" version of the CMF from 
    a Subversion checkout.

    - See "Installing CMF":INSTALL.txt to install from a tarball.

    - See the note below [1] if you want to export or check out
      the sources for a specific version from Subversion.

 * Please note that the trunk version of the CMF requires Zope 
   2.8.2 or later, as well as a more recent version of the Five product
   (1.2. or later) than the one which sships with Zope.  Installing the
   later version of Five in $INSTANCE_HOME/Products is sufficient to
   "shadow" the older version in $SOFTWARE_HOME/Products.

  * For help with Subversion in general, see "Version Control with 
    Subversion" at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

  * For directions on using the Zope Subversion server, see "The Zope Public 
    Subversion Repository", http://www.zope.org/DevHome/Subversion/FrontPage;
    substitute 'CMF' for 'Zope'.

Installation

  1. Fetch the CMF package from the Zope Subversion repository::

     $ cd /tmp
     $ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/CMF/trunk CMF-head

     This checkout creates a directory, 'CMF-head', which contain several 
     subdirectories:

      - CMFCore

      - CMFDefault

      - CMFTopic

      - CMFCalendar

      - DCWorkflow

     ... and several others.

  2. Copy or link each of these subdirectories into the 'Products' directory of
     your Zope server (either SOFTWARE_HOME or INSTANCE_HOME) e.g.::

      $ cd /var/zope/Products
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/CMFCore .
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/CMFDefault .
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/CMFTopic .
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/GenericSetup .
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/CMFSetup .
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/CMFActionIcons .
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/CMFUID .
      $ ln -s /tmp/CMF-head/DCWorkflow .
      ...

  3. Verify filesystem products:

     Start or restart your Zope server.  Check to see that the following 
     products are present in the Control_Panel / Products list;  each should 
     show a "normal" (non-broken) icon, and should have a version number 
     matching the release version of the snapshot:

      - CMFCore

      - CMFDefault

      - CMFTopic

      - GenericSetup

      - CMFSetup

      - CMFActionIcons

      - CMFUID

      - DCWorkflow

      ...

  4. Create a CMF Site:

     From the management interface, somewhere in the "main" section of your 
     site (*not* the Control_Panel!), select "Configured CMF Site" from the 
     add list.  Fill out the constructor form, and click the "Add" button.

Refreshing your Checkout

  To refresh an existing Subversion sandbox, you should use 'svn up'.

Fetching a Previous Version

.. [1]  A Subversion checkout as described above retrieves what is called 
        the "head" (the latest revision for each file) from the "main 
        trunk" (no unmerged branches).

  Retrieving Sources for a specific release
  
     Sources for prior releases are tagged, using the release version 
     number. For instance, version 1.5.2 of the CMF was tagged as 
     '1.5.2'.  To fetch such a release from Subversion::
  
      $ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/CMF/tags/1.5.2 CMF-1.5.2
