CMF 1.2:  Known Issues

  Overview

    This document describes known issues with the release of
    the Content Management Framework (CMF), version 1.2.
    For more information on the CMF, please see the "website",
       http://cmf.zope.org.


  Issue:  'CMFDecor'-based skins lost in upgrade to CMF 1.2

    When migrating a site to 1.2 from CMF, where the skin directories
    from the 'CMFDecor' product had been installed, such directories
    are no longer present (the product has been merged into 'CMFDefault').

    See the "tracker issue",
      http://www.zope.org/Products/PTK/Tracker/434

    Workaround

      1. Create an ExternalMethod in the root of your CMF site
         using the following properties:

         *Id* -- upgrade_decor_skins

         *Title* -- Upgrade CMFDecor Skin Directories

         *Module Name* -- CMFDefault.Upgrade

         *Function Name* -- upgrade_decor_skins

      2. Run this method by clicking on its "Test" tab.

  Issue:  Content constructor methods interface change

    The CMF used to require that factory methods for content instances
    return the URL of the "initial view" of the new object;  since
    August 2001, the interface has changed to require that the method
    return the new object directly, wrapped in its container.  This
    change will most likely affect ZClass-based content using the
    default DTML factory methods.

    Fix

      - Update all such methods to return the new object.  This
        update may be done more simply by replacing the generated
        DTMLMethod used for ZClass construction with an equivalent
        PythonScript.
