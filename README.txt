Zope Content Management Framework (CMF) README

  What is the CMF?

    The Zope Content Management Framework provides a set of
    services and content objects useful for building highly
    dynamic, content-oriented portal sites.  As packaged, the
    CMF generates a site much like the Zope.org site.  The CMF is
    intended to be easily customizable, in terms of both the
    types of content used and the policies and services it
    provides.
