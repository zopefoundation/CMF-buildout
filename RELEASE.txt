RELEASE.txt - notes for creating a CMF release

  Most of the work necessary to create a CMF release is done by the script
  'slurp_release.py', which can always be found in the root of the CMF 
  package on CVS-HEAD. The script will CVS export the CMF package, build the
  tarballs, and upload them and the respective READMEs to the CMF area on
  www.zope.org.

  Before running 'slurp_release.py' the respective branch needs to be cleaned
  up and tagged properly. 
  
  **Important note**: Always run all CMF unit tests before even thinking of
  cutting a new release.


  **Naming conventions**

    In order to stay consistent the following naming conventions for CMF
    versions and for CVS tags used to tag releases should be used,
    demonstrated with the help of a notional 1.8.4 release:

      - CMF beta versions are '1.8.4beta' and '1.8.4beta2' for the second
        beta. The same is true for alpha releases if one is desired.
        '1.8.4alpha2' follows '1.8.4alpha'. Alpha releases should only
        be necessary for the first release off a new release branch. The final
        version would then be '1.8.4'

      - CVS tags follow the convention 'CMF-1_8_4-release' or
        'CMF-1_8_4-beta'. As with version numbers, 'CMF-1_8_4-beta2' would
        indicate the second beta release.

      - Branch tags in CVS look like 'CMF-1_8-branch' for the branch that
        would yield e.g. version 1.8.4


  **Preparing the branch**

    To release version '1.8.4beta2' off the 'CMF-1_8-branch' the following
    steps are needed. It is assumed the release manager is using the HEAD
    of the 'CMF-1_8-branch' to make these changes:

      - At the top of 'CHANGES.txt', enter the current date as YYYY/MM/DD
        in parentheses next to the CMF version number.

      - Find all 'version.txt' files throughout the CMF package and adjust 
        the version number, in this case 'CMF-1.8.4beta2'.

      - Check these changes into the CVS repository

      - Tag the sandbox, in this case with the tag 'CMF-1_8_4beta2'


  **Creating and publishing the release**

    Now that the CVS repository is prepared the files need to be put onto
    zope.org. First of all, the Software Release object needs to be created.
    Go to http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF and create a Software Release 
    from the Folder Contents view:

      - Name CMF-1.8.4beta2

      - Version 1.8.4-beta2

      - Maturity value depends on status: beta releases are 'development'

      - License ZPL

      - Info URL '/Products/CMF/CMF-1.8.4beta2/README.txt'

      - License URL '/Resources/License/ZPL-2.1'

      - Changes URL '/Products/CMF/CMF-1.8.4beta2/CHANGES.txt'

      - Installation URL '/Products/CMF/CMF-1.8.4beta2/INSTALL.txt'

    Make sure to publish this Software Release. Due to a problem with the 
    zope.org site at the time of this writing, you need to specify an
    effective date on the publishing form if you want the item to show up on
    the zope.org front page. Just choose the current data using the date
    picker widget.

    With CVS and zope.org preparations done the 'slurp_release.py' script will 
    do the remaining work. You run it with the CVS tag and version ID as 
    parameters::

      slurp_release.py [options] release_tag version_id

    slurp_release can be run from anywhere, it does not depend on your CVS
    sandbox because it will create its own. Without any options it will 
    complete the whole procedure including upload to the zope.org site. 
    Use 'slurp_release.py --help' to find out more. The release_tag is equal 
    to the CVS tag in the repository (CMF-1_8_4beta2, to stick with our 
    example) whereas the version_id is the ID of the software release on 
    zope.org (CMF-1.8.4beta2).

    Once 'slurp_release.py' has completed the upload step you need to visit
    the uploaded files on zope.org and make sure they get published on the 
    site. See the note about specifying an effective date above.


  **Announcing the release**

    An announcement email should go out to zope-announce@zope.org, 
    zope-cmf@zope.org and zope@zope.org. Also, a NewsItem for the release
    should be created on the zope.org site. The existing News Items inside
    http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF can be used as models for your
    announcement.
