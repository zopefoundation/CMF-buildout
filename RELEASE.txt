RELEASE.txt - how to create a CMF release

  **Important note**: Always run all CMF unit tests before even thinking of
  cutting a new release.


  **Naming conventions**

    In order to stay consistent the following naming conventions for CMF
    versions and for Subversion tags used to tag releases should be used,
    demonstrated with the help of a notional 1.8.4 release:

      - CMF beta versions are '1.8.4-beta' and '1.8.4-beta2' for the second
        beta. The same is true for alpha releases if one is desired.
        '1.8.4-alpha2' follows '1.8.4-alpha'. Alpha releases should only
        be necessary for the first release off a new release branch. The final
        version would then be '1.8.4'

      - Subversion tags are the same as the version number. So our CMF 1.8.4
        release would be tagged as '1.8.4'. '1.8.4-beta2' would indicate the 
        second beta release.

      - Branch tags in Subversion look like '1.8' for the branch that
        would yield e.g. version 1.8.4. In essence, the branch tag only
        contains the major release number.


  **Preparing the branch**

    To release version '1.8.4-beta2' off the '1.8' branch the following
    steps are needed. It is assumed the release manager is using the tip
    of the '1.8' Subversion branch to make these changes:

      - At the top of 'CHANGES.txt', enter the current date as YYYY/MM/DD
        in parentheses next to the CMF version number.

      - Find all 'version.txt' files throughout the CMF package and adjust 
        the version number, in this case 'CMF-1.8.4-beta2'.

      - Check these changes into the Subversion repository

      - Create the Subversion tag by svn copying the head of the release
        branch to the tag in the tags repository directory.

      - Even though checking into a tag is an insidious thing to do, it is
        OK for changing SVN Externals definitions. Specifically, a CMF
        release tag should not contain SVN Externals pointing to branches.
        If needed, a tag on the external package should be cut and then
        the external definition adjusted to point to the tag.


  **Announcing the release**

    An announcement email should go out to zope-announce@zope.org, 
    zope-cmf@zope.org and zope@zope.org. Also, a NewsItem for the release
    should be created on the zope.org site. The existing News Items inside
    http://www.zope.org/Products/CMF can be used as models for your
    announcement.
