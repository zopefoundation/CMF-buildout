Temporary TODO list for the CMF 1.6 branch - will go away for the final release

  [x] Update deprecation warnings in the code, "will be removed in CMF 1.6"
      and "will be removed in CMF 1.7" becomes "will be removed in CMF 2.0"

  [x] finish the work that's necessary to make CMFSetup obsolete in CMF 2.0

  [ ] add a module alias for the setup tool to make sure CMF 1.5 setup tools
      still work in CMF 2.0
